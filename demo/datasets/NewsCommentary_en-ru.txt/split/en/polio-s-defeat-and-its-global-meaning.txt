Polio's Defeat and Its Global Meaning
<P>
A recent ceremony in Copenhagen marked a singular achievement in global public health, an achievement, which confirms that development aid works, and that it works best in partnership.
An independent commission certified the 51 countries of the World Health Organization European Region free of polio.
<P>
Adding the Europe Region to the Americas, China and the Pacific Rim, means more than half the world's countries - comprising over three billion people - are now officially free of this crippling disease.
The will to free the world of polio was underscored at the G8 summit in Canada, where G8 leaders pledged to help finish the job and rid Africa of the disease.
<P>
The success to date of the polio eradication program - clearing a huge swathe of the earth of an ancient scourge - demonstrates what can be achieved when simple technology is used effectively.
A closely coordinated effort amongst private and public sector partners to deliver oral polio vaccine to every child under five was the key to success.
<P>
Globally, international donors and UN agencies worked closely with national governments, tallying the exact needs for massive polio immunization campaigns aimed at reaching hundreds of millions of children.
Last year alone, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative delivered almost two billion doses of polio vaccine to 575 million children in 94 countries.
<P>
In each country, partner institutions including the minister of health, the World Health Organization, UNICEF, other UN agencies, service groups like Rotary International, representatives from donor governments, the private sector and non-governmental organizations, jointly and carefully planned each immunization campaign.
<P>
Every detail, from the number of bicycles and boats needed to deliver the vaccine to otherwise inaccessible areas, to the refrigerators and cold boxes needed to keep the vaccine potent, even the batteries necessary to power them, were counted and budgeted.
This close collaboration delivered the polio vaccine to the poorest of the poor, from the child living on a windswept island in the Congo River to the infant living in a tiny alleyway in Delhi.
<P>
The Global Polio Eradication Initiative is also fostering unprecedented public health action among nations in order to beat remaining pockets of polio in south Asia and parts of Africa.
In the midst of uncertainty following the terrorist attacks of September 11 th , the people of Afghanistan and Pakistan, determined not to let the conflict sidetrack progress in polio eradication, immunized 35 million of their children in coordinated efforts in September and November 2001.
African heads of state have personally launched polio campaigns synchronized across several countries, vaccinating tens of millions of children over a few days.
<P>
The investment of funds, political commitment and sound technical strategies delivers results, fast.
When this ambitious eradication program was launched in 1988, polio was paralyzing more than 1,000 children every day in 125 countries on five continents.
Last year, 480 children were paralyzed, in parts of 10 countries.
That's a 99.8% reduction, but it is still 480 children too many.
<P>
Saving children from the agony of polio is a great achievement, but the rewards for global public health are even greater.
A global polio laboratory network gives countries access to the most sophisticated disease surveillance system in the world.
Through collective support for polio eradication, health ministries now have the knowledge, the maps, the staff and the will of millions of volunteers to do even more.
<P>
Globally, investing in polio eradication helps everyone.
As the worldwide polio burden plummets, we become safer from importations of the virus.
This is a real concern, as children in Bulgaria were paralyzed only last year due to polio imported from India.
To protect every child, polio must be eradicated globally.
Once it is, we may eventually be able to stop immunization against the disease, and save up to US$1.5 billion every year in averted immunization and treatment costs.
<P>
So, as polio nears eradication, the world is on the verge of delivering the first global public good of the new millennium.
But the risk not finishing the job boils down to a common problem: the need for more funding.
<P>
The Global Polio Eradication Initiative, spearheaded by the WHO, Rotary International, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and UNICEF, urgently requires US$275 million to fill a funding gap for immunization activities.
This is a small price to pay to ensure that six billion doses of polio vaccine reach 600 million children over the next three years.
It is a small price to prevent a disability that drives countless families into desperation and poverty.
<P>
The G8 leaders' commitment to increase support for polio eradication in Africa is promising.
But there are immediate needs - the programme is short US$60 million this year alone.
Without these funds, polio immunization activities will have to be postponed, cancelled or seriously cut back in several countries.
<P>
We have invested much in this fight.
Failure to eradicate polio for lack of funds would be a squandered opportunity for the world.
With a little more investment, we can deliver a polio-free world to our children, indeed, to all children for all time.

Germany's Banks Confront The World
<P>
FRANKFURT: Corporate governance is very much an issue of the day, both in the East and in the West.
In the countries emerging from the communist block the question of who will ultimately replace the state as the monitor of company performance is one on which the viability of the new market economies might very well depend.
Given the complexity of the institutions underpinning the financial markets in the developed economies and the difficulty of establishing them in the transition countries, many have looked to the German "universal banks" as a model for the postcommunist countries.
<P>
The origin of the universal banking system goes back to a situation facing the 19th century Germany that was in some ways similar to that confronting the transition economies today: the financial needs of the rapidly growing heavy industries which -- in the face of the underdeveloped capital markets in Germany-- could only be met by commercial banks, many of which were founded by industrial leaders themselves.
The tradition that developed as a result, in which banks were the main source of finance to industry, is very different from both the more capital-market-oriented financial systems of America and Britain, and the system of state-led credit-rationing and capital allocation that has been historically prevalent in France and Japan.
<P>
Ever since the 19th century, Germany’s economy has been characterized by close relations between business and finance.
These links were not confined to credit relations, but also extended to direct and indirect shareholdings by the banks and their representation on the supervisory boards of firms.
Combining their role as creditors and corporate monitors, banks developed stable relationships with industrial firms which substantially added to long-term corporate stability.
Disruptive and time-consuming bankruptcy proceedings could be avoided as banks often provided the necessary fresh funds to support corporate restructuring.
<P>
But at the very time that many countries in the East are looking to German universal banks as a model, new competitive pressures in the West are rapidly transforming the German prototype, leading to new patterns of commercial relations between German business and finance.
Three major forces drive this process forward:
<P>
• An ongoing process of financial “disintermediation.”
Big German corporations no longer depend exclusively on banks for their finance but, increasingly, are tapping international capital markets directly, so as to raise funds through commercial paper, bond, or equity issues.
This results in the “securitization” of the traditional financial assets, and forces German banks to shift their focus from the old-fashioned lending business into securities underwriting and trading activities.
<P>
• The accelerating globalization of corporate investment and production.
In a quest for economies of scale and a strategic repositioning of facilities in order to survive in a world of fast growing competitive pressures, globalization adds to the process of corporate restructuring, mergers, and acquisitions.
These changes create a fertile ground for a fee-based corporate advisory business, an area of banking that has traditionally been a stronghold of US investment banking.
German financial institutions now recognize that they need to be competitive with the Americans in their global investment banking capabilities -- including the skills of take-over finance -- if they want to get a hold of a large chunk of this highly profitable business.
<P>
• The approach of European Monetary Union.
EMU will further accelerate these fundamental changes by stimulating cut-throat competition and creating a large and liquid capital market, leading to a shake-out in the financial sector itself, as corporations consolidate their European banking relations among a smaller number of institutions.
<P>
Under the impact of these forces it is to be anticipated that, in future, Germany’s financial landscape will move closer to the more capital-market-oriented model.
Inevitably, these changes will have consequences for the traditional system of corporate governance.
<P>
As the process of disintermediation adds to the influence of institutional investors other than banks, these nonbank investors are likely to become dominant shareholders and demand a larger say on the supervisory boards of German firms.
International pension funds, mutual funds, German corporate pension plans, as well as insurance companies already play a leading role on the German stock market, and calls for corporate managers to focus on increasing shareholder value (as opposed to the older, more consensus-oriented corporate policy) are getting louder -- not only on the trading floor, but also in the boardroom.
<P>
Given this shifting business mix, German universal banks will increasingly find themselves focusing on their roles as creditors and corporate advisors, with their role as shareholders receding somewhat into the background.
Because of this, their traditional position on many supervisory boards will have to be reassessed and eventually adapted to fit changing circumstances.
<P>
Does this mean that just as the institution of universal banking is being held up as a model in many postcommunist countries, we are witnessing its end in Germany itself?
I don’t think so.
In adapting to today’s globalization, German banks, with their multiple roles, have a considerable advantage deriving from the diversification of their earning streams, as compared to institutions more exposed to the inherent volatility of most trading and fee-based advisory income.
Even the banks' traditional role of long-term support in corporate governance maintains its enduring attractiveness, and its extension to countries going through an early phase of economic liberalization and corporate growth increases the prospects of their long-term success.
Let's not forget that these new markets still represent the largest fraction of the globe and it is there that today’s global financial institutions are battling for tomorrow’s global market share.

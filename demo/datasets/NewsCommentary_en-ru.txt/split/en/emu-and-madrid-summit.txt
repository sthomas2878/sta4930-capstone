<HEADLINE>
EMU and Madrid Summit
<P>
European Monetary Union (EMU) is on its way.
At the recent
<P>
Madrid summit a framework for the changeover was decided.
EMU
<P>
starts in January 1999 with those countries that fulfill the
<P>
famous convergence requirements (inflation and interest rates,
<P>
budget deficit, total outstanding government debt, exchange
<P>
rates).
Six to eight countries may make it.
Germany and France
<P>
must be among them.
Without them, no EMU will take place.
<P>
France is trying to qualify by forcing its budget deficit down.
<P>
As the strikes revealed, there is little understanding of global
<P>
economic competition among the French population.
Germany is
<P>
also trapped.
It suffers from large unexpected fiscal shortfalls
<P>
and won't find it easy to keep EMU reference ratios.
Most other
<P>
candidates are also not yet out of the woods.
Nevertheless,
<P>
realization of monetary union, while hanging in the balance, has
<P>
never been closer since the Maastricht Treaty was signed.
<P>
Why should transition countries care?
The answer is simple: The
<P>
European Union (EU) has decided that all future members must
<P>
underwrite the final goal of monetary union.
(Only the United
<P>
Kingdom and Denmark may opt out.)
In the long run, those who
<P>
want to join the EU will have to conform to its requirements.
<P>
It is unlikely that any new members will be able to meet the
<P>
convergence criteria soon.
In fact, application of these
<P>
criteria to the transition countries does not for now make sense.
<P>
There are too few government bonds, and their yield levels must
<P>
be reviewed.
Outstanding government debt levels can hardly be
<P>
judged before the privatization process -- and the settlement of
<P>
old bank debt -- is completed.
Exchange rate performance can
<P>
only be measured after full liberalization of capital flows.
<P>
From their own perspective, it would in fact be premature for
<P>
transition countries to give up sovereignty on exchange rate and
<P>
monetary and fiscal policies, even if they could join the EU at
<P>
an early date -- and there is some doubt whether they can.
<P>
Although a well performing neighbor cannot be kept banging at the
<P>
European door for too long, the timing of membership depends not
<P>
only on the applicants' economic performance, but also on the
<P>
EU's ability to reform its protectionist Common Agricultural
<P>
Policy (CAP).
Without such reforms, integrating just the Central
<P>
European states would require some 40-60 bln ecu per annum.
In
<P>
view of EU budget constraints there is no political support for
<P>
this.
<P>
But for economic policies in Eastern Europe, EMU matters now.
<P>
The new Euro will provide a stable anchor currency.
Transition
<P>
country trade is largely with EMU countries (or in the case of
<P>
central Asia, with a Turkey that is tied into an EU customs
<P>
union) and they will need to set exchange rate targets and
<P>
policies vis-a-vis the new European currency.
<P>
EMU fundamentals should help in the drive towards market economy.
<P>
Convergence toward internal and external stability in a market-driven environment, supported by an independent central bank, not
<P>
bound to finance government deficits, are key elements of
<P>
economic success.
As Western Europeans learned, inflation
<P>
followed by devaluation does not produce sustainable growth.
The
<P>
EMU convergence policies should be embraced as a platform for
<P>
reform.
<P>
The same does not apply to full currency convertibility.
In the
<P>
step-by-step order of the transformation towards a market
<P>
economy, full convertibility is not a priority.
Free capital
<P>
movements become important only down the road.
They are a must
<P>
for any country that seeks integration into the world economy and
<P>
wants to be able to draw on world savings.
While some transition
<P>
countries have made progress here, most have far to go.
<P>
Assuming a "hard-core EMU" begins in 1999, it will pull on other
<P>
EU countries to join.
But, for a number of years to come, there
<P>
will be a ring of non-members around the core EMU countries.
<P>
What exchange rate relations should they have with EMU?
This is
<P>
a crucial issue - for members and non-members.
It is about price
<P>
competitiveness of, say, French versus Italian cars or machine
<P>
tools as well as transition country exports to EMU markets.
<P>
A free-for-all of competitive devaluations is not the answer.
On
<P>
the other hand, exchange rate policy arrangements like the
<P>
European Monetary System (EMS) with its strict rules may be
<P>
premature for many countries in transition.
Still, the basic
<P>
principles of sound monetary and fiscal policies, low inflation,
<P>
and stable currencies must take root and a "soft version" of the
<P>
EMS may promote convergence.
<P>
When the EMS was initiated in the late 1970's by President
<P>
Giscard d'Estaing and Chancellor Schmidt, it was ridiculed by
<P>
many "experts."
Gradual convergence of economic policies brought
<P>
about by the EMS during the 1980's inspired the EMU vision.
The
<P>
growing economic and political coherence of Western Europe helped
<P>
bring down the Iron Curtain.
Here is an example worth imitating.

Selfless Seigniorage
<P>
NEW YORK – As the central banks of major developed economies have intensified quantitative easing (QE, or large-scale purchases of government bonds and other long-term securities), developing-country leaders have increasingly voiced concern about the policy’s adverse impact on their economies’ stability and growth.
They cite the dangers of volatile capital inflows, commodity-price fluctuations, and local-currency appreciation, as well as the attendant risks of asset bubbles and inflation.
<P>
Developed-country policymakers do not deny these spillover effects.
Rather, they contend that QE’s positive externalities – namely, a stronger recovery in developed economies – will ultimately offset them.
<P>
But one issue seems to have been neglected by both sides.
QE has enabled developed economies to collect a massive amount of international seigniorage (the interest that a central bank earns on the assets that it holds against the currency that it issues, or the annual increment in the monetary base) from developing countries.
<P>
Since the global financial crisis erupted in 2008, developed-country central banks have used QE to expand their balance sheets significantly.
The total value of assets held by the US Federal Reserve, for example, has ballooned from 7% of GDP in 2007 to roughly 20% of GDP today.
The four major central banks – the Fed, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, and the Bank of England – have accumulated roughly $5 trillion of additional assets in the last five years, bringing their total to $9.5 trillion.
<P>
As QE expands the size of these central banks’ balance sheets, the monetary base (currency in circulation and commercial banks’ reserves) also grows.
The extent to which the central bank expands the monetary base, therefore, increases the size of the seigniorage for these countries’ governments.
<P>
According to the International Monetary Fund’s April 2012 fiscal monitor report, the seigniorage levied by developed-country governments surged from about 1% of GDP in 2005-2007 to roughly 8% of GDP in 2008-2011, an increase of about $2.7 trillion.
Since 2012, additional rounds of QE have generated an additional $1 trillion in base money.
In other words, in the last five years, developed-country central banks’ ever-expanding QE operations have enabled their governments to collect $3.7 trillion in seigniorage.
<P>
These governments are not only appropriating resources from domestic households and businesses, subtracting from their consumption and investment; given that major developed countries issue international-reserve currencies, they are also collecting seigniorage from developing countries’ growing foreign-exchange reserves.
In doing so, they have been able to transfer a significant share of the financial costs associated with their post-crisis policies to developing countries.
<P>
In fact, QE has driven developing countries to expand their foreign-exchange reserves by roughly $2.8 trillion since 2008, as the added liquidity that the policy has generated has moved to developing countries through trade and capital flows.
Inflexible exchange-rate policies in some developing countries may have intensified the effects of this process.
<P>
While the privilege of issuing international-reserve currencies allows developed countries to accrue international seigniorage, it does not mean that they should use the revenue in whatever ways they wish.
Claims by some that the United States uses the international seigniorage that it collects to finance global security are unconvincing and do not justify the practice (much less America’s massive military expenditures).
<P>
With the world facing substantial economic, social, and environmental challenges, the issuers of major reserve currencies should allocate the international seigniorage that they levy to finance sustainable development worldwide.
This includes increasing official development aid to the least-developed countries, thereby supporting poverty-reduction efforts and accelerating progress toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals, and raising their contribution to global funds to address climate change and protect global commons.
<P>
Given that QE affects all countries – often negatively – the revenue that it generates for developed-country governments should be used for the benefit of all.
No objective is more universal – or more pressing – than addressing the shared challenges of sustainable development.

The Atlantic Divide In Black and White
<P>
Relations between Continental Western Europe and the US have never been so strained in recent decades as they are now.
Is the cause a short-run disagreement about a specific issue, the war in Iraq?
Or is the transatlantic ideological divide deep, pervasive, and unlikely to disappear anytime soon?
<P>
Before diplomats and pundits begin to paper over the two sides' differences, it is necessary to reflect on their sources.
For we believe that the transatlantic divide does mirror fundamental differences in values--with the immediate caveat that these differences do not, and should not, bring the two sides into conflict.
<P>
The profoundly different values that America and Europe hold can best be viewed by examining how each perceives poverty, inequality, and the welfare state.
According to the World Value Survey, a respected attitudinal study conducted in about 40 countries, 60% of Americans believe that the poor are "lazy," a view shared by only 26% of Europeans.
Nearly the exact opposite proportions (60% of Europeans and 29% of Americans) believe that the poor are trapped in poverty.
<P>
Similarly, evidence drawn from surveys about well being indicates that Americans are much less bothered by inequality than Europeans.
In fact, even the American poor do not mind inequality, which they see as a social ladder that they can climb.
The European poor view inequality as an insurmountable social obstacle.
<P>
These basic differences lead to obvious consequences for social polices.
Europe spends twice as much as the US on social programs, and total government spending in Europe is close to 50% of GDP.
In the US, government consumes about 30% of GDP.
These numbers are not just about social spending, but have implication for issues like defense and foreign policy.
<P>
If Europe wants to play a more active role in international affairs it must become a military power: the US spends about 4% of its GDP more than Europe for military purposes.
But this is difficult for Europe to achieve, let alone contemplate: looming deficits and exhausted taxpayers make it hard, if not impossible, to divert several percentage points of GDP to military spending.
<P>
But where do these differences in attitude toward fundamental issues like inequality come from?
One explanation is that America is a more mobile society where the poor are not trapped and can seemingly get out of poverty if they really try.
If the poor remain poor, Americans conclude, it must be because they are lazy.
The European poor do not have such mobility and thus lack the supposed chance that poor Americans possess.
Even if they try hard, they feel trapped.
<P>
The alternative, and much more likely, explanation is that these differing views reflect profound ideological differences that pay little attention to economic reality.
In other words, the ideological differences across the Atlantic are much larger than actual differences in social mobility and the supposed laziness of the poor.
<P>
European culture remains profoundly affected by the Marxist intellectual tradition in which classes are viewed as cast in stone--which implies that it is almost impossible for a poor person to become rich, or, apropos the tradition, for a "proletarian" to become a "capitalist."
Marxism assumes social immobility to justify the concept of "class."
In many European countries, political institutions were shaped in revolutionary periods in which socialist parties and ideas enjoyed mass support.
European constitutions often reflect an emphasis on equality and redistribution.
<P>
In America, the Marxist cultural influence was very limited.
Indeed, outside of universities, it scarcely ruffled American life.
Instead, the culture (or myth) of the "self-made man" provides the ideological tool for America's social conservatives to justify limited government intervention.
The US Constitution, though reshaped, amended, and adapted to fit changing times, reflects its origins as a document written and designed to protect private property against the predations of the State.
<P>
The second source of the transatlantic divide in attitudes toward fundamental issues like inequality has to do with racial bias.
The US is a racially fragmented society, so it is convenient for the majority of wealthy whites to view the poor (many of them black) as different and lazy compared to hard-working whites.
<P>
Indeed, even controlling for income, whites are much less receptive to redistributive policies than non-white Americans, precisely because they perceive them as favoring racial minorities.
Even poor whites oppose redistributive policies, owing to racial distrust, if not downright animosity.
Historically, America's racial and ethnic divisions also inhibited the development of a homogeneous working-class culture and movement, which empowered socialist and Communist parties across Europe in the 20 th century.
<P>
In more homogeneous European countries, the differences between rich and poor are much less obvious: in Sweden, rich and poor are all white, often tall and blond.
Not surprisingly, the European right is beginning to use immigration as a tool to attack the welfare state.
As Europe becomes increasingly multi-cultural, political pressures against the welfare state seem certain to grow.
<P>
For now, Americans and Continental West Europeans remain very different in their basic attitudes concerning poverty, inequality, and the welfare state.
It remains to be seen whether these attitudes will persist in their current form, and whether the transatlantic divide widens or narrows.

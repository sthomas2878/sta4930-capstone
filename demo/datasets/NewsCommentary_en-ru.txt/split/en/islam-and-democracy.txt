Islam and Democracy
<P>
WASHINGTON D.C.: Reform is afoot within Islam.
It contrasts starkly with the extremism that grabs headlines when bombs are planted, hostages seized, or embassies attacked in Islam's name.
<P>
Ideas of reform emerged periodically among small groups of clergy and intellectuals over the past century, but new thinkers and writers are bringing broad reform ideas to large audiences.
<P>
Simply put, new reformers contend that Islam is flexible; that Islam's tenets can accommodate and even encourage pluralism.They are challenging those who claim Islam is unchanging across time, space or experience.
And they oppose those shrill voices who argue democracy is incompatible with Islam.
The reform movement is trying to reconcile Islam and modernism by creating a late 20th century worldview both modern and Islamic.
<P>
One leading reformer is Iranian philosopher Abdul Karim Soroush, a media-shy academic whose training and experience span the Middle East and the West.
<P>
Soroush supported Iran's 1979 revolution and took an active role in revising university curricula in the revolution's early years.
But he has since formulated ideas deemed controversial by the regime.
So powerfully do his ideas resonate that high ranking officials such as Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, successor to Ayatollah Khomeini and now Iran's Supreme Guide, increasingly frame public remarks to take account of, and respond to, Soroush's articles and speeches.
<P>
Educated in London and Tehran in both philosophy and the physical sciences, Soroush has recently taught at Iran's Institute for Human Research and Tehran University's School of Theology.
His columns are the centerpiece of Kiyan, a magazine founded in 1991 primarily to air his views and the debates they spark.
Soroush's ideas are also spread by the informal talks he gives at Tehran mosques, gatherings that include young clerics, regime opponents, intellectuals, political independents and even government technocrats.
<P>
Soroush's writings on two subjects are particularly relevant to the reformist debate.
Democracy tops the list.
Although Islam literally means "submission," Soroush argues that there is no contradiction between Islam and the freedoms inherent in democracy.
<P>
"Islam and democracy are not only compatible.
Their association is inevitable.
In a Muslim society, one without the other is not perfect," he said in one of several interviews.
<P>
Advocacy of Islamic democracy is based on two pillars.
First, to be a true believer, one must be free, says Soroush.
Belief formed under pressure or coercion is not true belief.
And if a believer freely submits, this does not mean that he has sacrificed freedom.
He must also be free to leave his faith.
The only real contradiction is to be free in order to believe--and then afterward to have that freedom abolished.
The freedom required to be a true believer is also the basis for democracy.
<P>
Soroush goes further in defining freedom.
The beliefs and will of the majority of people shape the ideal Islamic state, he says.
An Islamic democracy cannot be imposed from above.
It is only legitimate if it has been selected by the majority of the people, believers and non-believers alike.
<P>
Second, understanding of religion is relative, he says.
Interpretation of religious texts is always in flux because the meaning of sacred texts are influenced by the age and changing conditions in which believers live.
No interpretation is absolute or fixed for all time and all places.
<P>
Furthermore, in no small part because of freedom, everyone is also entitled to his or her own understanding.
No one group of people, including the clergy, has the exclusive right to interpret or reinterpret tenets of the faith.
Some understandings may be more learned than others, but no version is automatically more authoritative than another.
<P>
Islam is also a religion that can still grow, Soroush argues.
It should not be used as a modern ideology, for it is likely to become totalitarian.
<P>
Soroush does believe Sharia, or Islamic law, should be a basis for modern legislation.
But Sharia, too, can change.
"Sharia is something expandable.
You can't imagine the extent of its flexibility," he said.
"And in an Islamic democracy, you can actualize all its potential flexibilities."
<P>
Secularism is the other broad subject Soroush tackles.
It is not the enemy or rival of religion, he says.
It is instead its complement, even its savior.
Arabic does not have a literal word for secularism.
But a 19th century Arabic word -- scientificness -- comes close.
<P>
"It means to look at things scientifically and behave scientifically--which has nothing to do with hostility to religion.
And secularism is nothing more than that," he argues.
<P>
The ancient world had a single source of information based on religion.
Modernism attempted to free humankind from the "dictatorship of religion" by introducing a second source of information -- reason.
The tension between reason and religion since the sixteenth century has been "welcome and beneficial for both" and opened the way for the eventual reconciliation or equilibrium between the two, he explains.
<P>
Soroush's work echoes themes that spawned the Christian Reformation.
He shows how to empower Muslims by establishing the rights of individuals in Islam.
And he divides the roles and powers of mosque and state--a stunning shift for the only major monotheistic religion that prescribes rules by which to govern society as well as spiritual beliefs.
<P>
Sorous does not abandon the values of Islam.
But he shows how to open up Muslim societies and the Islamic faith.
In the process, the reformation he propounds provides an Islamic foundation for a pluralist and tolerant environment and eventually, perhaps, a democratic society.

Trump’s Unrealpolitik
<P>
NEW YORK – Some in the United States have praised President-elect Donald Trump for his supposed realism.
He will do what is right for America, they argue, without getting caught up in thorny moral dilemmas, or letting himself be carried away by some grand sense of responsibility for the rest of the world.
By acting with the shrewd pragmatism of a businessman, he will make America stronger and more prosperous.
<P>
This view is, to be frank, delusional.
<P>
It is certainly true that Trump will not be caught up in questions of morality.
He is precisely what the Greek historian Thucydides defined as an immoral leader: one of “violent character” who “wins over the people by deceiving them” and by exploiting “their angry feelings and emotions.”
<P>
But immorality is neither desirable nor a necessary feature of realism.
(Thucydides himself was an ethical realist.)
And there is little to suggest that Trump has any of the other realist qualities that his supporters see.
How could anyone expect the proudly unpredictable and deeply uninformed Trump to execute grand strategic designs, such as the Realpolitik recommended by Harvard’s Niall Ferguson, Henry Kissinger’s biographer, following the election?
<P>
Ferguson, like Kissinger, believes that true Realpolitik under Trump should begin with an alliance among the US, China, and Russia, based on a mutual fear of Islamic extremism and a shared desire to exploit lesser powers to boost their own economies.
These countries would agree to prevent Europe from attaining great-power status (by destroying the European Union), and to ensure that populist or authoritarian governments control the United Nations Security Council’s five permanent members.
<P>
To this end, Trump could work with Russian President Vladimir Putin to help Marine Le Pen, the leader of France’s anti-EU nationalist right, win April’s presidential election.
Moreover, in order to consolidate a post-EU Anglo-Atlantic sphere, Trump could transform the North American Free-Trade Agreement into a North Atlantic arrangement, replacing Mexico with the United Kingdom.
Finally, he could put pressure on NATO members to pay more for defense – a move that would surely undermine the security of the Baltic states and Ukraine.
<P>
Achieving these goals would require more than an ability to avoid moral impediments.
Like all statecraft, it would require an aptitude for careful diplomatic engineering, respect for facts and truth, historical knowledge, and a capacity for cautious examination of complex situations when formulating (or revising) policies.
<P>
Yet Trump is the most anarchic, capricious, and inconsistent individual ever to occupy the White House, and all he has to help guide him is a cabinet full of billionaire deal-makers like him, preoccupied with calculable immediate interests.
For them, casting off allies might seem like an easy way to streamline decision-making (and boost share prices).
<P>
But repudiating America’s role as a global beacon – and thus the idea of American exceptionalism – is a bad bet for the future.
Scrapping free-trade deals with Asia and Latin America, for example, could provide a short-term gain for the US economy; but doing so would ultimately undercut the projection of American power there, paving the way for penetration by China.
<P>
The US should be aiming to curtail China’s influence without incurring its wrath.
Another lesson from Thucydides – reinforced by historical experience – is that rising, not established, powers tend to upset the international order.
<P>
Protecting that order requires the main global power to uphold the institutions that underpin it, in order to prevent revolutionary behavior by lesser powers.
Yet Trump has criticized and disregarded international institutions to such an extent that it is now China that is defending global governance – including the Paris agreement on climate change and the nuclear deal with Iran – from a revolutionary US.
<P>
Worse, Trump has seemingly abandoned all caution with regard to China.
On the diplomatic front, by speaking directly with the president of Taiwan after the election, he violated a protocol maintained for four decades, by Democratic and Republican presidents alike.
On the economic front, he has leveled reckless (and plainly wrong) accusations that China is manipulating its currency to gain an unfair trade advantage.
<P>
Provoking China, doubting NATO, and threatening trade wars is nihilism, not strategy.
At this point, Trump seems set to do on a global scale what former President George W. Bush did to the Middle East – intentionally destabilize the old order, and then fail to create a new one.
The first step would be a deal with Putin on Syria – a move that, like Bush’s defeat of Saddam Hussein in Iraq, would amount to handing a victory to Iran.
<P>
This is not to say that none of the Realpolitik envisioned by Ferguson will come to fruition.
But what elements of it do emerge will likely be driven more by Putin than by Trump – with dangerous outcomes.
Already, Putin has begun work on dismantling the EU.
After Le Pen was refused credit from French banks, Russian banks saved her campaign.
And Russian state-sponsored propaganda is helping to drive former Soviet republics away from the EU.
<P>
Trump, a vocal Putin fan, is unlikely to redress the tilting balance of power as part of, let alone as a condition for, a diplomatic “reset” with Russia.
What kind of a realist would not use a united Western alliance to limit a Russia that is trying to engineer a return to Cold War spheres of influence?
<P>
And, for that matter, what kind of a realist sends to Israel an ambassador whose pro-settlement rhetoric threatens to inflame the entire Muslim world against the US?
What is so realistic about a war of annihilation against the Islamic State that is not backed by a plan for engagement with the broader Middle East?
<P>
Trump might have some realistic instincts.
But they will not be enough to ensure measured responses to even the slightest provocation, much less to underpin a sweeping and consistent strategy.

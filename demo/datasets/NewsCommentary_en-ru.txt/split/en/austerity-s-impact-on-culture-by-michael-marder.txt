Uncultured Austerity
<P>
VITORIA-GASTEIZ – Culture is the silent victim of the euro crisis.
Last month, the Portuguese government announced the definitive closure of 38 cultural and social foundations and 100% cuts in the funding of 14 more.
<P>
Likewise, the Spanish government has reduced public funds allocated to cultural organizations by 70% in the last three years.
Despite State Secretary of Culture José María Lassalle’s previous affirmation that culture is “neither a luxury nor a caprice,” the new budget of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy’s government did not spare the hallmark Prado Museum, the Institute of Cinematography, or even the Network of Public Libraries, which will receive no money for new books next year.
<P>
Meanwhile, in the Netherlands, arts funding has been slashed by 25%.
And Italy’s La Scala opera house faces a $9 million shortfall, owing to reductions in subsidies.
<P>
Such decisions rest on the premise that culture is nothing but superfluous entertainment.
After all, who needs circuses when there is no bread?
<P>
But this assumption is deeply flawed.
Strategies for overcoming the euro crisis have been rooted in the same narrow-minded economic thinking that led to it in the first place.
As a result, fiscal deficits continue to grow, while the strict austerity programs designed to reduce it have merely undermined business and consumer confidence and damaged people’s well-being.
<P>
Cultural production, the wellspring of collective imagination, generates resources for finding creative solutions to problems – even those that seem completely disconnected from art.
In fact, even on the market’s implacable terms, cultural production – one of those rare “industries” that has shown persistent, long-term growth over the last decade – could well be a much-needed niche for European exports.
<P>
But policymakers continue to overlook this potential.
For example, in Cascais, Portugal, Casa das Histórias, a museum dedicated to the artist Paula Rego, has been a great success, with more than 300,000 visitors since its opening in September 2009.
But it will be closed down, and the more than 500 works that Rego donated will be deposited in the city hall.
<P>
In her work, Rego explores humanity’s unconscious, animalistic foundations.
For example, through her depictions of women and children as real physical beings, rather than as idealized figures, she challenges viewers to confront that which they usually ignore.
Casa das Histórias, like other museums and cultural organizations, provides visitors with an opportunity for self-reflection – much needed in times of crisis.
<P>
Cascais’s ex-mayor, António Capucho, called the decision to close Casa das Histórias “barbaric,” saying that it reflected an “error in calculations.”
But last month’s announcement by the Portuguese government showed that the error was never corrected.
<P>
When austerity undermines art, culture, and imagination, it defies critical thinking.
To overcome the crisis, policymakers must reject solutions born of old thinking and begin to think anew.
Sustaining and fostering cultural production would be an ideal place to start.

The Stealth Threat to World Trade
<P>
Threats to world trade come in many guises.
The usual suspects include protectionist barriers and militant anti-globalization protests of the type that derailed the “Millennium Round” of World Trade Organization (WTO) talks in Seattle last year.
Although these protests grab headlines, a new and perhaps even more insidious threat to world trade has quietly taken shape over recent years: so called “open sectoralism,” or the practice of negotiating access to foreign markets on a selective, industry-by-industry basis.
<P>
What this practice entails is that countries negotiate lower tariffs on some types of products but not on others.
Contrary to appearances, open sectoralism is not a first step to more comprehensive trade agreements.
Indeed, it may prevent wider agreements from being negotiated.
<P>
For even when successfully negotiated, sectoral agreements jeopardize economic efficiency and performance by protecting the least competitive industries because each country tries to open trade in areas where it is competitive.
No country likes to open its manufacturing dinosaurs to foreign competition.
The economic implications of such a stance, however, are perverse.
Imagine an America or Europe still stuck in the 1950s, with economies dependent on coal and steel, and textiles, and with no competition from cheaper producers in Asia and elsewhere, and the danger becomes obvious.
<P>
A second danger arises from the fact that, by liberalizing trade for only a few economically successful industries, open sectoralism weakens, rather than strengthens, the broad political support needed for the comprehensive global trade agreements that benefit most businesses, consumers, and countries.
<P>
America is the keenest supporter of open sectoralism, beginning several years ago with the “zero-for-zero” tariff negotiations during the Uruguay Round of world trade talks.
Those talks led ultimately to the dismantling of tariff barriers in ten key sectors.
Pushed by business, the US negotiated sectoral agreements in telecoms, information technology, and financial services.
The first major deal, the Information Technology Agreement (ITA), took effect in 1997 and covers 90% of trade in IT products worth more than $600 billion annually.
<P>
The ITA was subsequently backed by the European Union after Hugo Paemen, the EU ambassador to the US, saw the ITA as proof that sectoral agreements help circumvent mounting political resistance to new trade rounds.
With the support of the two most powerful actors in world trade, the ITA model has been pursued ever since in other sectors.
A Global Agreement on Basic Telecommunications went into effect in 1998; a Financial Services Agreement to liberalize trade in banking, insurance, and securities was implemented in April 1999.
<P>
Such agreements, which often dismantle not only tariffs but other regulatory barriers, may appear unassailable.
But looks deceive.
Because the powerful sectoral interests that supported liberalization during the Uruguay Round – information technology, financial services, telecommunications – now have their own deals, the energy they once brought to the cause of broader trade liberalization has diminished sharply.
Indeed, the Japanese believe that the halfhearted backing of US business groups for a new round of WTO talks reflects the success of the earlier sectoral agreements.
So Japan now opposes negotiating a second ITA, which it fears will further weaken political support for broad trade liberalization.
<P>
Fears for the future of comprehensive, multi-sector trade negotiations are well founded.
Continuing effort by US officials, for example, to focus narrowly on trade in services and agriculture impedes wider agreements by limiting the tradeoffs that can be made among sectors.
Moreover, a sector-by-sector approach invariably ignores a host of issues within the WTO, such as dispute settlement, anti-dumping, and the like.
<P>
The recent experience of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum highlights the limitations of open sectoralism and should prompt a thorough re-appraisal.
Following the launch of the ITA, America pressed APEC’s members for accelerated liberalization on a sectoral basis as a means to revive a stalled regional trade agenda.
But efforts to reach an agreement to liberalize trade in 15 sectors soon faltered: the cost of selective liberalization in uncompetitive, but politically sensitive, sectors was simply too high for some governments to bear.
<P>
The most important lesson of APEC’s failure is a recognition of the enormous difficulty found in constructing a broad enough, and yet politically acceptable, package when trade negotiations are limited to particular beneficiaries.
Because some industries no longer care about wide trade agreements because they have already benefited through a sectoral deal, the groups that normally see themselves as gaining from greater trade openness are too weak to offset the political influence of protectionist forces mobilized against liberalization.
<P>
Policymakers who are now attracted to open sectoralism because of its delusive promise of frictionless politics should take that lesson to heart.
If the full benefits of trade liberalization are to be gained quickly, there is no alternative to resuming comprehensive negotiations – and the tradeoffs between industries that this strategy entails – by reviving the WTO’s Millennium Round.
It is this agenda, rather than the hollow hope of open sectoralism, that should be the main priority of trade negotiators in the future.

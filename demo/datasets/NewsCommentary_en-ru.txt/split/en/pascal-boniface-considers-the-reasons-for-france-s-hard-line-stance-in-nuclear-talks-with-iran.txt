Iran’s French Resistance
<P>
PARIS – At the start of the latest round of nuclear talks between Iran and the P5+1 (the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, plus Germany), many believed that an interim agreement – which would freeze Iran’s nuclear program while a longer-term deal was negotiated – was within reach.
Indeed, hopes had been rising since the election of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, a reputed moderate who seemed ready to bring a new level of openness and flexibility to negotiations.
But, far from producing a breakthrough, the talks yielded only a promise to hold further discussions.
<P>
Many observers claim that France’s intransigence stymied a compromise that the other parties would have considered acceptable.
Some even go so far as to say that France’s resistance reflected a desire for Israel’s approval.
<P>
As is often the case, there is no smoke without fire.
Bernard Kouchner, during his stint as foreign minister, stated publicly that France’s position on Iran sent a positive signal to Israel.
And French national-security officials, who refuse to budge on non-proliferation, have clashed with those who claim that a nuclear-armed Iran could enhance regional stability by counterbalancing Israel, the Middle East’s sole nuclear power.
<P>
Likewise, French President François Hollande has assured Israel that France will oppose easing international sanctions until Iran has definitely halted its pursuit of nuclear weapons.
With Hollande set to visit Israel in just a few days, the press there has been heaping praise on France’s resolute stance.
US Senator John McCain and the Wall Street Journal – not usually France’s biggest fans – have joined the chorus.
<P>
Nevertheless, the claim that French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius is pandering to Israel is downright wrong.
Recall that, while Hollande was dragging his feet, Fabius secured France’s vote in favor of Palestine’s upgrade to “non-member observer” status at the UN – a move that displeased Israel’s government and the Representative Council of French Jewish Institutions.
Yes, Fabius took a firm stance during the recent talks with Iran, but not to please the Israelis.
<P>
First, there is the bitter legacy of Iran-France relations during Fabius’s stint as Prime Minister in 1984-1986, a period during which 96 foreigners – many of them French – were kidnapped by Iran’s allies in Lebanon.
Moreover, Fabius has been a vocal critic of Iran for supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime.
But, above all, he simply wants an airtight guarantee that Iran will dismantle its military nuclear program.
<P>
France’s hardline approach is viewed positively in the Gulf states and the wider Arab world, not least because of broad agreement with the French position on Syria.
By upholding this principled stance, while keeping the prospect of a compromise open, France could guide the creation of a more easily exportable agreement.
<P>
That will require demonstrating that whatever deal is reached was not a rush job, and that concerns about Iran’s nuclear program – such as the heavy-water reactor site at Arak, which is likely to produce plutonium – have been addressed effectively.
Such an agreement would be difficult for critics to decry, and could help to overcome conservative opposition in the United States.
<P>
With a new round of talks already being launched, little time has been lost in pursuing this goal.
Given that nuclear negotiations with Iran have been going on for more than a decade, and that avoiding military conflict remains paramount, a few extra days is surely an acceptable concession.
In this case, getting it right matters as much as getting it done.
<P>
This approach underscores the importance of the ultimate goal.
The failure of Iran’s new, more open government to strike a deal would likely lead to the return of conservative leadership in Iran and a renewed threat of military conflict.
And Fabius is well aware of the potential value of Iranian markets for French businesses.
Sanctions are hitting Iran hard, but they are also hurting French companies.
<P>
Israel is opposed to any agreement with Iran.
France would like to see one, but only if it is accompanied by numerous guarantees.
That is not same thing.
<P>
If the next round of negotiations produces an agreement, France will have pulled off a daring diplomatic feat.
It remains for the West to offer Iran adequate options for credibly terminating its military nuclear program.

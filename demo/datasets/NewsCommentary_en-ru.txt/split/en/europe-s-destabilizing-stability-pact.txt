Europe's Destabilizing Stability Pact
<P>
Europe's Growth and Stability Pact is under threat as never before.
Even European Commission President Romano Prodi now calls it "stupid."
In many ways, he may not be wrong.
<P>
Last summer, as soon as it became clear that Germany's mounting budget deficit might exceed the Stability Pact's ceiling, Chancellor Schr√∂eder postponed a tax cut he had already announced rather than cut public spending.
The French government, unwilling to cut its swollen public sector, is now thumbing its nose at the Stability Pact and its enforcers in the European Commission, saying that it has "different priorities" than those required by the pact.
The question now is whether or not the Stability Pact can long survive the antagonism of the EU's two biggest economies.
<P>
The Stability Pact emerged after a long period (part of the 1970s, all of the 1980s, and a good portion of the 1990s) during which many European countries lost control of their fiscal balances.
The Stability Pact initially sought to force countries that wished to join European Monetary Union to bring their budgets closer into balance and to slash excess debt.
Now, however, its built-in flaws are being revealed.
<P>
The biggest problem concerns the fact that the Stability Pact focuses on a country's budget deficit, rather than on the component parts of government budgets: taxes and public spending.
Europe's fiscal problems have their roots in governments that are too big and that require, in order to pay for their bloated size, levels of taxation which grossly interfere with the incentives individuals need to work harder, invest more, and run entrepreneurial risks.
Setting a limit on a country's overall budget deficit - as the Stability Pact does - cannot correct this distortion.
<P>
Between 1995 and 2002, notwithstanding the Stability Pact, total public spending in the euro area (net of interest and of capital spending) remained virtually unchanged: it amounted to 41% of the euro zone's GDP in 1995; it will amount to 40.7% of GDP this year.
Meanwhile, gross government investment, already minuscule, contracted even further: from 2.7% to 2.4% of GDP.
<P>
As a result of the Stability Pact, teeny differences in budget outcomes acquire a prominence in Europe's economic policy debate that is not only ridiculous on their face, but distract attention from Europe's real budgetary problems.
Few people seem aware of the margin of error that exists when computing such numbers.
<P>
It is not uncommon, say, for parliamentary discussions about a budget to turn on the question of whether or not such an such an action will lead to a deficit of 0.8 or 1.1% of GDP-blithely unconcerned that the difference between those numbers is well below the statistical margin of error.
Futile debates of this type are a handy excuse for a country to avoid facing its real fiscal challenges: unsustainable pensions, unemployment benefits that discourage workers from looking for a new job, public sector wage bills unrelated to productivity.
<P>
In addition to shifting Europe's focus from its real budget challenges, the Stability Pact is indiscriminate - ie, it treats both high and low-debt countries in the same way.
Greece and Italy, whose total public debt exceeds 100% of annual GDP are treated in the same manner as Portugal, where the debt-to-GDP ratio is around 45%.
Such equivalence neglects the reason why the Stability Pact was created in the first place - to compel the most heavily indebted governments to put their fiscal house in order.
<P>
The third destabilizing factor built into the Stability Pact is the fact that it virtually invites governments to engage in creative, Enron-style accounting - ie, it encourages governments to cheat.
Changing the composition of the public debt, for instance issuing consols rather than bonds that pay a coupon, is often sufficient to lower the official deficit by a few decimal points, and this is only one in a finance minister's large black bag of tricks.
<P>
Europe desperately needs lower spending, especially on pensions and wages, and lower taxes.
Clearly, the Stability Pact cannot deliver the incentives needed to achieve these goals.
In fact, it may interfere with the one realistic way to reduce the size of government: cut taxes first, get European taxpayers accustomed to a lower burden, then create political incentives to reduce spending.
<P>
By remaining obsessed about the first decimal point of a deficit, even in a time of prolonged stagnation, Ecofin (the Council of European finance ministers) misses both the point of its mission, restraining the most profligate of government debtors, and the big picture about bringing growth to Europe.
In the end, if a European country, especially one of the EU's big four of Germany, France, Italy and the UK, wants to run a deficit that exceeds the strictures of the Stability Pact, it will do so with impunity, as France is doing now.
<P>
Two years into the euro's life, the Stability Pact that underpins the currency serves only the purpose of beating up on small countries (remember what happened to Ireland, which has as virtuous a budget balance as any country in Europe but which dared lower taxes against the Stability Pact's rules?).
It is time for a change in how the European Commission thinks, for less of an obsession with deficits and more attention to government spending.

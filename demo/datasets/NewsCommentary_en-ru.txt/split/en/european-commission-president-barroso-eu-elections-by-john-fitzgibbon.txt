An Elected European President?
<P>
CANTERBURY – Earlier this month, European Commission President José Manuel Barroso delivered his annual State of the Union address.
But, like many recent events related to European affairs, the speech received little media coverage, and went unnoticed by most Europeans.
<P>
The little attention that the speech did receive focused on Barroso’s call for “a democratic federation of nation-states.”
But Barroso, who had not previously been known as a European federalist, was not merely fiddling around the edges of European law.
Rather, he invoked federalism to show that European integration is already moving decisively in that direction.
<P>
More significant was Barroso’s call for European political parties to nominate candidates to succeed him in the 2014 parliamentary elections.
The European Council would consider the parties’ suggestions when appointing the next Commission President.
<P>
While the largest Europarties – the European People’s Party and the Party of European Socialists – have presented presidential candidates in the past, a Europe-wide electorate had never before been explicitly linked to the filling of this appointed position.
Indeed, although Europarties are relatively well developed, they have yet to resonate with voters, who remain unconvinced of their relevance, given that the locus of electoral politics in the European Union remains at the national level.
<P>
Barroso’s statement thus acknowledged anew, on behalf of the Commission and the Council, the democratic deficit that has long plagued EU institutions – a deficit that they aim to close by creating a pan-European political sphere.
If the European Parliament serves as a quasi-electoral college that determines the presidential appointment, voters might care more about Europe – and support further integration.
<P>
Some observers, like the political scientist Stefano Bartolini, oppose the use of political parties to narrow the deficit, arguing that politicizing European integration would undermine the consociational decision-making ethos that has underpinned the EU’s success.
But others, such as the London School of Economics’ Simon Hix, insist that to reengage with the EU, voters need to be able to make choices that have real policy consequences.
<P>
As with most EU developments, dramatic institutional change will happen gradually through extensive negotiations and the treaties that result.
But Barroso’s declaration directs discourse relating to the democratic deficit in a specific direction – one that will likely resemble the European Parliament’s transition from an appointment-based system to direct election.
<P>
As commentators focus almost exclusively on the economic impact of the euro crisis and the European Central Bank’s increasing authority to resolve it, they are missing the first steps in a crucial complementary development.
Europe-wide presidential elections, for which many senior political figures have called, would help to stem the erosion of political legitimacy that has cost the EU, in its technocratic incarnation, the respect, sense of identification, and even the attention of its citizens.

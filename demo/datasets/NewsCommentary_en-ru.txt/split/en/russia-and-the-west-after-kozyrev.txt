Russia And The West After Kozyrev
<P>
MOSCOW: President Yeltsin’s long expected threat in mid-October to fire his longest serving minister, Andrei Kozyrev, incited concern all over the world.
That decision was withdrawn almost instantly, on the eve of Yeltsin’s visit to France and the U.S. Obviously the Russian President was unwilling to travel with a non-minister of foreign affairs in toe.
<P>
Many reasons animated Yeltsin’s choice to make - and unmake - that decision.
Kozyrev’s inability and unwillingness to forge a unified and coordinated foreign policy was the most obvious.
Under Kozyrev’s non-leadership Russia could not even command the modest resources at its disposal.
Foreign Minister Kozyrev is also blamed for a collapse in morale within the diplomatic corps.
His rhetorical about-faces as he sought to transform himself from ultra-liberal to ultra-nationalist left Russian diplomats dispirited and fatally undermined his former ability to portray Russia as a benevolent and democratic country.
<P>
Worse, Kozyrev’s flip-flops, coming on the heels of his "Yes, yes, yes" policy in response to Western requests, earned him universal mistrust of Russian elites - nationalist and Westernizing alike.
<P>
Kozyrev may hang on as foreign minister, but few in Moscow think this ultimate survivor will survive for long.
Most Russians will applaud his fall.
No matter its timing, the end of Kozyrev’s sway over Russian foreign policy exposes a number of hard questions, both for Russia and the West.
<P>
Although Russia is poised to begin a period of economic growth as economic stabilization has at last taken root, the country’s political mood is volatile.
In foreign policy, jitteriness reflects the lingering humiliation many feel after the loss of the country they considered their motherland, and the failure of Kozyrev to define a new and appropriate Russian role in the world.
Any show of disrespect - real or imagined - is suffered acutely.
NATO’s bombing of Bosnia’s Serbs against Russia’s protests hit a raw nerve in many influential Russians.
<P>
Economic aid, promised by the West but never delivered, also hardens dissatisfaction among many, including liberals.
Wishful thinking always produces disillusion.
For many Russians lost illusions about the West incite an urge to roll up one’s sleeves to get on with the business of building the country, with its huge natural and human resources, on our own.
But for others, more every day, they are a cause for mounting xenophobia.
<P>
Plans to expand NATO will drive more people into this camp.
Not only is expansion deemed against every vital Russian interest, it is also viewed as an explicit breach of trust.
When the USSR voluntarily retreated from East and Central Europe, permitting the peaceful reunification of Germany, Mikhail Gorbachev and Soviet leaders were promised that NATO would not rush to fill the space vacated by the Warsaw Pact.
Indeed, when Gorbachev insisted this promise be inserted into the new treaties being negotiated between the USSR and the states of East/Central Europe - in the form of clauses banning them from entering new alliances - Russia was told not to worry and that NATO expansion was not in the cards.
Moreover, it was argued that such clauses would prevent these countries from entering the European Union, something Russia had no interest in blocking.
<P>
Upcoming elections, in America and Russia, will fray what trust remains.
America’s Republicans aim to make foreign policy the Achilles heel of the Clinton administration, transforming Russia policy from asset to liability.
A few influential cold warriors long for a new Russian threat, even if concocted, as an organizing rule in US diplomacy.
<P>
Such political gamesmanship will push into the background the vital issues - managing the nuclear legacy, nonproliferation, containing instability - that unite Russia and the West.
Clearly secondary issues - Iran, Bosnia, how many troops Russia keeps in the Caucasus - will come to the fore for political reasons alone.
<P>
But I do not believe that Russia and the West are inexorably sliding into an unnecessary and farcical (the first was tragic) second Cold War.
A majority of Russia’s elites, despite their bitterness, are neither willing, nor can they afford, to run the future like the past.
The country is now capitalist, and at least semi-democratic.
It would be virtually impossible to impose the vast redistribution of resources necessary to renew global confrontation.
<P>
Even if menacing, most nationalist rhetoric simply provides a safety valve for Russian frustrations.
Classic examples of this are the cries to renew the empire.
Almost everyone calls for reintegration of the former USSR; almost no one is willing to pay a ruble for it.
<P>
The West, too, is starting to understand that in today’s international disorder, Russia, though weak, can have a lot of negative - nuisance - power if not kept as a partner.
It is also becoming hard for Westerners to see the new market-oriented Russia as building itself up only to become a threat.
<P>
If both sides avoid mistakes (and Bosnia is little hope here), compromise can be found on NATO expansion and other divisive issues.
If so, both parties can sail through the next 14-18 months of rough water to arrive at a less close but probably more robust relationship, one free of false expectations, but also of disappointments - partnership whenever possible, and competition when necessary.
That time frame is dictated mostly by the Russian and American election timetables.
<P>
Kozyrev’s departure will provide an opportunity for a healthier relationship.
The West will know that in his successors they face Russian politicians whose policies are based on national interest, not ideological friendship or hatred.
Once institutionalized, Russian policies will be more predictable.
No longer would the person in charge of Moscow’s diplomacy be seen at home as someone disloyal to Russian interests.
A foreign minister the Russian public and Russian elites trust will have more freedom to maneuver in relations with the West.
<P>
The task for the interim period is clear: predict crisis and avoid making them worse; widen channels of communication, so that hot rhetoric is not taken too seriously.
<P>
Russia has a special task.
It must start very rapidly to build a coordinating mechanism for Russian foreign policy, something almost non-existent after years of Kozyrev’s mismanagement.
Unless Russia speaks with a united voice, it will remain doomed to unpredictability and incomprehension.

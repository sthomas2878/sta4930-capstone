Europe's Tattered Social Contract
<P>
CHICAGO: Europeans defend their highly regulated and taxed labor markets by claiming that they produce less inequality in earnings than the more free market practices of the United States and the United Kingdom.
They emphasize that, since the late 1970's, wage rates in America and Britain of the better educated and more skilled have risen sharply relative to those of other workers.
By contrast, the skilled-unskilled wage gap of employed persons only increased modestly in Germany, France, and most other Western European countries.
<P>
But most European nations experienced a distressing change during the late 1980's and the 1990's in their employment situation: the number of persons without jobs has expanded greatly.
In effect, European labor markets divide workers into "insiders" and "outsiders".
Insiders have jobs, and are typically members of powerful trade unions.
Their employment is protected by seniority and union rules, and also often by government regulations that limit layoffs.
Since they face little competition from new entrants into the labor force and from others looking for work, wages of both skilled and unskilled insiders have risen over time at a good pace along with the growth in productivity.
<P>
Outsiders, on the other hand, cannot easily get good jobs, so their incomes come not from their productivity but mainly from social security and other welfare programs that are increasingly in financial trouble.
Outsiders include the unemployed, and persons who exit from the labor force either because they despair of finding work, or are induced to leave by generous retirement and disability benefits.
<P>
In the late 1970's, unemployment rates in most of Western Europe were below those in the United States.
While American rates have generally remained between 5 and 7%, and British rates have come down, European unemployment increased during the 1980's and skyrocketed in the nineties.
Over 11% of the labor force in the European Community do not have jobs.
Germany, the most powerful nation there, now has an unemployment rate in excess of 12%, and the highest number of unemployed since Hitlerâ€™s early rule.
<P>
The European unemployment burden is not distributed evenly among economic and demographic groups.
It bears down most heavily on the backs of the young, less educated, and women.
Hardest hit are Moslem and Catholic minorities from North Africa, Turkey, and Eastern Europe.
Nor is the burden shortlived: more than 30% of the unemployed are without jobs for over a year.
Young and other new entrants into the labor force and workers who lost their jobs have special difficulties in finding work.
<P>
Even the soaring number of long term unemployed is only one dimension of the job crisis since many Europeans have left the labor force.
Yet the United States economy has continued to add job opportunities at a remarkable rate since the early 1980's, with nearly two-thirds of Americans over age 15 finding work.
By contrast, in France only 55% of persons in these age groups have jobs, in Germany less than 58%, and the employment picture is still more dismal in Spain, Italy, Sweden, and some other nations in Europe.
<P>
Even the rather meager increase in European employment during the past twenty years has been artificial since the number of jobs in the private sector has hardly increased at all.
Employment has been added mainly in government-owned industries and other State sectors that are notoriously overmanned.
In America and Britain, practically all the job growth has been in private companies, especially in new start ups.
<P>
The situation can continue to deteriorate as Europe struggles to reduce their government budgetary deficits before 1999 to the under 3% level required by the Maastricht Treaty.
This may be largely accomplished by creative accounting, but it is also putting pressure to cut staffs in many state-run enterprises that are losing money.
<P>
In light of these trends that differentiate the relatively good fortunes of insiders from the dismal prospects of growing numbers of outsiders, it is inappropriate to call European labor markets more "fair" than American and British markets.
Measures of equity and inequality that consider both the low earnings and harmful psychological effects from not being able to work would rank Europe much lower than the more open and less regulated American and British markets.
<P>
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and other leading European politicians speak frequently about the need to raise employment.
But Europe will be unable to provide many new jobs in the private sector until it levels the playing field by reducing the heavy tax and regulatory burden which is discouraging companies from adding employees.

The Road from Benghazi
<P>
POMONA – Last year, on the anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States, an assault on the US mission in Benghazi, Libya, led to the deaths of four American diplomats, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens.
The attack, which caused the US government to cancel public-diplomacy programs, evacuate offices, and tighten security substantially, was a massive setback for American diplomatic efforts in Libya.
<P>
At the time, I was the public affairs officer at the US embassy in Tripoli, responsible for strengthening US-Libyan ties, which were minimal, at best, during Muammar el-Qaddafi’s 42-year rule.
Libya’s new government allowed me access to civil-society actors – including journalists, academics, writers, activists, and representatives of minority groups – who were off limits to US diplomats under Qaddafi’s regime.
<P>
These interactions revealed that most Libyans hold positive views of the US, owing to America’s support for Libya’s 2011 revolution.
Given this, the US seemed to have a tremendous opportunity to build strong bilateral ties, nurture robust people-to-people connections, reduce the appeal of extremism, and contribute to capacity-building in many areas, including security.
<P>
After the Benghazi attacks, I grieved not only for my fallen colleagues, but also for the loss of the chance to deepen a relationship that had, in Qaddafi’s final years, consisted mainly of counterterrorism efforts, limited commercial relations, and historical issues, such as the 1988 Lockerbie bombing.
Stevens, who championed a more comprehensive approach, would have been devastated to witness the fortress that the US embassy became after his death.
<P>
To be sure, tightening security and reducing the scope of public-diplomacy efforts was the right move in the wake of the Benghazi attacks.
But, as time has passed, it has become increasingly apparent that US politics is paralyzing diplomatic operations in Libya as much as security concerns are.
By exploiting the Benghazi attack to criticize the Obama administration, American politicians like Representatives Darrell Issa and Jason Chaffetz have made US diplomats’ job in Tripoli increasingly difficult – and have driven the Obama administration to lose sight of the Libyan opportunity.
<P>
While Libya’s current security situation, circumscribed by institutional paralysis and societal confusion, is undoubtedly worrying, it should not obscure the efforts of countless Libyans to build a new Libya.
They want desperately to connect with America, but they are being given remarkably few opportunities to do so.
<P>
For example, my interviews with Libyan professors applying for Fulbright grants to study at US universities underscored how limited the linkages between American and Libyan scholars and institutions were.
Qaddafi’s government largely neglected Libya’s universities, depriving faculty of the kinds of international contacts and collaboration that are central to academic life.
As Ethan Chorin recently highlighted, although Esso (Exxon) fellowships enabled hundreds of Libyans – many of whom went on to play integral roles in the 2003-2007 US-Libya rapprochement – to study in the US in the late 1970’s and 1980’s, such programs were shuttered through the early 2000’s.
Ultimately, almost all contact between Libya and the US was cut off, depriving an entire generation of the opportunity to cultivate people-to-people exchanges.
<P>
Changing this will require significant political will, greater diplomatic engagement, and a stronger policy focus.
But restoring US-Libya ties cannot be left only to government; universities, foundations, and other organizations must also do some heavy lifting.
One promising initiative (in which I am involved) aims to establish an American Institute of Maghreb Studies in Libya – similar to existing institutions in Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia – that would facilitate the kinds of institutional and scholarly exchanges that are the hallmark of US public-diplomacy efforts.
<P>
Unlike the other Arab Spring countries – where populist nationalism cloaked in anti-American sentiment is flourishing, and attacks on US-funded institutions and non-governmental organizations are not uncommon – Libya retains a deep reservoir of goodwill toward the US, among both its people and their new government.
Time and again during my 14 months there, I experienced this goodwill firsthand, most notably after the Benghazi attacks.
Against this background, continuing to neglect relations with Libya would be a major strategic mistake for the US (and the West more generally), as would allowing turmoil in Syria or instability in Egypt to shape Americans’ attitudes – and thus US policy – toward Libya.
<P>
Given that educational and cultural exchanges cannot flourish in a dangerous environment, the US and other Western countries are correct to focus on strengthening Libya’s security apparatus.
At the same time, however, they should be working to develop ties in areas such as higher education, scientific research, the arts, culture, and health.
Disregarding the immense potential of such linkages would be an affront to the Libyans who sacrificed their lives to create a new, more open, and prosperous Libya.
That is the last thing Stevens would have wanted.

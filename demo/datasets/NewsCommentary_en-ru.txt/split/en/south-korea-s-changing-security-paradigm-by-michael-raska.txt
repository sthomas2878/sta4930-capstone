South Korea’s Changing Security Paradigm
<P>
SINGAPORE – Since the Korean War ended, the divided Korean Peninsula has stood at the center of complex power constellations in Northeast Asia involving the United States, Russia, China, and Japan.
But, while South Korea’s geostrategic location and historical legacy – together with the enduring nationalist sentiments, alliance politics, territorial disputes, and superpower rivalries at play throughout the region – have generated a persistent security dilemmas, the country’s closest neighbor poses its defining security challenge.
<P>
The bitter political, strategic, and territorial rivalry between North and South Korea has generated what is essentially a zero-sum conflict on the Peninsula.
Given the need to prevent another war, South Korea’s national-security strategy – based on the mutually reinforcing pillars of defensive deterrence, alliance with the US, and forward active defense – has remained relatively constant for more than six decades.
<P>
But, in the last decade, South Korea’s security environment has become increasingly complex, as traditional threats, scenarios, and contingencies linked to conventional, high-intensity warfare have converged with asymmetric and unconventional threats.
In fact, two major threats, stemming from North Korea’s divergent potential development trajectories, are, by their nature, polar opposites.
<P>
The first threat is rooted in North Korea’s pursuit of enhanced military capabilities through a ballistic-missile program and the development of weapons of mass destruction (nuclear, chemical, and biological).
In recalibrating their WMD development and testing strategies, North Korea’s leaders hope to offset the military and technological superiority of the US-South Korea alliance, thereby attaining greater economic and political leverage in the region, and, most important, guaranteeing the regime’s survival.
<P>
This final motivation highlights the second major threat to the Peninsula’s stability: the specter of a failed state.
North Korea’s ever-worsening economic situation, internal structural erosion, and international isolation have substantially increased the risk of volatility, with potential outcomes ranging from implosion to explosion.
<P>
The mutable source, nature, and character of the North Korean security threat has hampered the ability of South Korean defense strategists to minimize the risks and anticipate the costs of potential confrontations, spillovers, or crises.
In this context, a new strategic paradigm that allows for greater flexibility, adaptability, and autonomy amid significant uncertainty is crucial.
<P>
But South Korea’s political and strategic legacies, together with interoperability requirements and linkages with the US, have impeded the required defense transformation.
In order to develop a new security paradigm, South Korea must address for five key constraints:
<P>
· The challenge of ascertaining North Korea’s strategic intentions, which amplifies regional uncertainty, increases the risk of miscalculation, and mitigates the reliability of South Korean deterrence.
<P>
· The so-called “strategic premium” – that is, the cost of any preemptive military action by South Korea or the US against North Korean WMD sites or force concentrations.
<P>
· The prohibitively high socioeconomic costs of building up a defense force that could deter or quickly crush a North Korean invasion and avert serious damage to Seoul and the surrounding area.
<P>
· The involvement of superpowers, whose strategic interests limit South Korean foreign policy and defense strategy, thus undermining prospects for Korean unification.
<P>
· The political ramifications of de facto security dependence on the US, codified in the 1953 US-South Korea Mutual Defense Treaty.
<P>
In order to reduce South Korea’s reliance on its security alliance with the US and amplify the country’s deterrence and defense capabilities vis-à-vis both North Korea and longer-term regional threats, political and military leaders have called for comprehensive military modernization.
But such efforts have so far focused on “hardware” modernization – allocating resources for the procurement and acquisition of selected advanced weapons technologies, systems, and platforms, and integrating them into existing organizational force structures and operational concepts.
The relevant “software” elements – the organizational, conceptual, and policy innovations needed to use the new technologies – have been largely neglected.
<P>
South Korea must prepare not only for a conventional scenario of all-out war, which would require responding quickly to a surprise attack by North Korea.
Effective deterrence and defense against possible long-range artillery barrages, missile attacks, infiltration, and WMD-related asymmetric forms of warfare are also essential.
In this context, South Korea’s traditional linear defense planning – assessing the environment, identifying specific threats, formulating options, evaluating priorities, and defining core objectives, strategy, and policy – may no longer be sufficient.
<P>
South Korea needs a new, comprehensive defense strategy that can more easily be adapted to shifts in its strategic environment.
At the same time, military forces need to become sufficiently flexible and robust to operate effectively under diverse scenarios.
This means abandoning South Korea’s long-standing, static defensive posture, which emphasizes conflict avoidance and excessive reliance on US forces.
To face its new security threats, South Korea needs a new security apparatus that depends on innovation, adaptability, and vision.

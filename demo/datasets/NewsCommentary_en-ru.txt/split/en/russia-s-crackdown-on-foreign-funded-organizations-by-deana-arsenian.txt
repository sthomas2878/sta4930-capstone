Russia’s Foreign Friends
<P>
NEW YORK – For the last nine years, Russia’s President Vladimir Putin has hosted the Valdai International Discussion Club, devoting time and attention to leading Russia experts from around the world.
Putin’s interest in these discussions suggests that he is open to alternative perspectives about Russia’s development and global role.
But his government’s position toward noncommercial institutions with foreign ties and foreign organizations operating in Russia raises concerns that it has lost sight of the value of international cooperation.
<P>
Since Putin first became president in 2000, Russia’s political, economic, and social stability has been largely restored.
But, while his government’s policies helped to put Russia on the path to recovery, public- and private-sector entities worldwide also contributed, devoting time, energy, and capital to helping Russia to discard inefficient Soviet-era structures and pursue a society based on democratic principles, the rule of law, and a market economy.
<P>
Their efforts bolstered Russia’s transformation into a stable, prosperous, and internationally engaged country.
Rather than pursuing their own interests, foreign-funded organizations have largely based their actions on concern for Russia and its citizens, and on the belief that what is good for Russia is good for the rest of the world.
Such sentiments have guided Russia-relevant programs for decades – in both turbulent and prosperous times.
<P>
Foreign entities that have made substantial investments in Russia’s future include American philanthropic organizations, such as Carnegie Corporation of New York, as well as other Western donors.
Such organizations have worked with Russian institutions and ministries to smooth the country’s post-Soviet transition, responding to needs that Russia’s citizens and leadership have defined.
<P>
For example, such foundations supported struggling Russian universities after the Soviet Union’s collapse, helping them to regain their status while rebuilding academic programs in all disciplines.
These organizations have supported thousands of Russian scholars, academics, and scientists, enabling them to contribute to Russia’s transformation, rather than having to join many of their colleagues in pursuing opportunities elsewhere.
<P>
Moreover, through research and travel grants, foreign organizations have connected Russian intellectuals to the outside world, facilitating the linkages that are crucial in modern academic communities.
They have worked with Russian civil-society leaders to strengthen the country’s nongovernmental sector, a basic element of a functioning democracy.
And they have funded programs aimed at creating and implementing effective policies to secure Russia’s vast nuclear arsenal at a time when the country’s ability to do so was dangerously weak.
<P>
Given this legacy of heavy investment by the Western public and private sectors in Russia’s future, the Putin government’s position on foreign and foreign-funded organizations seems puzzling.
Recent steps – including the closure of the United States Agency for International Development, a requirement that foreign-funded noncommercial institutions register as “foreign agents,” termination of the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, and harassment of foreign civic and philanthropic entities – undermine the progress that US-Russian partnerships have enabled.
<P>
Many observers are relieved that Russia no longer needs external aid to support groups and activities that previously relied on it.
But the Putin government’s policies, and the ways in which they are being implemented, do not do justice to Russia’s past, present, or future.
Instead, they diminish recent accomplishments, negate successful partnerships, and preclude the kind of international collaboration that has benefited Russia and the world.
<P>
Having presided over the country for more than a decade, Putin is in a unique position to achieve what no previous Russian leader could: making Russia part of the solution to global challenges, rather than part of the problem.
A self-reliant, self-confident, transparent, strong, and engaged Russia is in the interest of not only Russia’s leaders, but also of the foreign-funded organizations that have made such valuable contributions to its development.
<P>
The government’s punitive approach to those who care deeply about Russia’s future undermines this vision.
Putin should act in the best interests of his country – and the rest of the world – by establishing Russia as a positive global force that is not afraid of its foreign friends.

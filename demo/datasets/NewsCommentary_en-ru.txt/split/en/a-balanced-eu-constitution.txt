A Balanced EU Constitution
<P>
EU Commission President Romano Prodi has proposed a scheme to strengthen the Union's executive.
Britain, France, and Spain are working on an opposing plan that will consolidate EU executive powers among the biggest EU states.
What's the ordinary European to think?
<P>
Europe's citizens scarcely grasp the issues at the heart of the European Constitutional Convention in Brussels.
Mountains of detail obscure problems; sterile, misleading national discussions that pit "Euroskeptics" against "Europhiles" muster sound and fury but clarify nothing.
So complicated do many issues seem that some newspapers and broadcasters have abandoned reporting about the Convention.
<P>
EU citizens can secure a clearer understanding of what the Convention should achieve by asking this question: how should governmental functions be divided between the EU and its member nations?
To answer this, we need to grasp government's true purpose.
<P>
Government should provide citizens with public goods: collective defense, legislation and regulation, enforcement of the rule of law.
These can be provided at different levels: local, regional, national, or supranational government, i.e., the EU.
But what is the right level?
<P>
In some areas, decentralization works because it recognizes diverse local or national communities.
However, local decisions often have repercussions on citizens in other communities.
So certain services should be allocated to a broader geographic unit because they have externalities (that is, interdependence of effects).
<P>
Europe's allocation of governmental powers should be based on the principle that institutions carry out only those activities with clear economies of scale and where differences of opinion are modest.
The lower a government activity's externalities, the more it should be localized.
Low externalities imply limited benefits to be gained from centralization; deep differences among citizens imply that the costs of harmonization would be too high.
<P>
The euro, for example, delivers clear advantages of scale by favoring international commerce and avoiding negative externalities.
No longer can the lira be devalued to favor Italian exports to the detriment of the French, followed by a French reaction, etc.
Although the imperfectly synchronized economic cycles of EU members causes friction over monetary and exchange rate policy, the euro's benefits outweigh the costs of diversity.
<P>
In educational policy, however, to impose the same system on all members would not create economies of scale.
Cultural differences are too strong to win voluntary compliance.
It would be absurd to delegate education and culture to a supranational level.
<P>
Of the areas of public policy with high economies of scale or externalities, two stand out: the common market and competition; and foreign policy and defense.
The former covers antitrust, trade, and the common currency.
Some think that fiscal policies - from the structure of taxation to welfare, to budget balances - should also be harmonized.
But national preferences are diverse, and if mechanically imposed, fiscal centralization might incite resistance.
<P>
Nor do centralized fiscal policies have any real raison d'Ãªtre from a constitutional point of view.
The US Constitution, for example, does not prescribe balanced budgets for the states.
Only in exceptional circumstances is fiscal harmonization justified: prohibitions, say, on fiscal incentives aimed at limiting competition, impeding commerce, or restricting the movement of capital.
<P>
Foreign policy and defense belong, par excellence, at government's apex.
There are clear externalities and economies of scale.
It would be absurd if New York pursued a different foreign policy than Texas.
Much the same is true in Europe.
<P>
The addition of new EU members implies that more internal differences will occur, which means that fewer centralized policies are justified.
These considerations suggest a series of principles for the Convention to consider:
<P>
1.
The EU Constitution should establish unequivocally which prerogatives belong to Europe and which to member countries.
When in doubt, the principle of subsidiarity suggests that national states remain supreme;
<P>
2.
European-level institutions should guarantee the functioning of markets, including competition, commercial, and monetary policies;
<P>
3.
Fiscal policy should remain largely decentralized, save for a few exceptions;
<P>
4.
Foreign policy and defense are areas of federal competence, to be delegated to Europe at a proper time;
<P>
5.
The creation of new areas of federal competence should be accompanied by decision-making mechanisms found in genuinely representative democracies.
So "No centralization without representation."
<P>
Today's EU diverges enormously from these principles (see table), as is demonstrated by the fact that agriculture, which represents 2% of European GDP, accounts for 40% of EU expenditures.

Europe faces an historic opportunity.
America's founding fathers wrote a Constitution that has lasted over 200 years.
Members of the European Convention obviously face a far more complex and diverse society-and thus a more daunting constitutional challenge.
But they can succeed by displaying comparable wisdom and foresight.

Towards a People's UN
<P>
A new session of the UN General Assembly has opened in New York.
Talk of crisis abounds.
The United States may be stripped of its vote for non-payment of overdue bills.
A new vision for the UN is needed, suggests Vaclav Havel.
<P>
PRAGUE - Today, the United Nations appears incapable of ratifying any document whose significance would match that of, say, the preamble to the UN charter or the glories of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
Last year, indeed, I witnessed that impotence myself during the preparations of the UN’s anniversary summit, when attempts were made behind the scenes to adopt a concise document of a declaratory nature that would respond, in a fundamental way, to the changes that have taken place in the world over the past fifty years.
<P>
While taking part in those preparations, I soon realized how difficult it now is to reach global agreement on anything.
It is not that no one was willing to agree to the proposed texts, but many were concerned about who wrote them, and whether the authors were not people whom they should oppose.
Others wanted to have some phrase or paragraph added or deleted for reasons of sheer prestige.
As a result of this -- not surprisingly -- no document of any nature was produced.
<P>
Despite this failure, and the sterility it betokens, I still believe that those of us who want to can make an effort to highlight the spiritual dimension and spiritual origin of the values guarded by the United Nations, and to translate those values into the organization's practical activities.
If a better future for this world lies in the realm of the spirit, in the realm of moral order, and in a renewed sense of responsibility for this world - as I believe it must and does - who but the United Nations should be the one to catalyze this again and again?
<P>
Much has been said about reform of the institutions of the UN, including the General Assembly and the Security Council, indeed of the entire UN itself.
What I should like to propose in this regard may sound rather unrealistic at present, but I still feel that I should share my ideas for reform, because I am deeply convinced that these ideas, and the values that animate them, could enrich the unique and tremendously important endeavors of the UN in the future.
<P>
I have already touched upon my first proposed change: I deem it advisable that the United Nations become the scene of a quest for a common denominator of spiritual values uniting the different cultures of our present world.
The UN should look for ways in which the entire system that is aimed at fostering all the rights and responsibilities shared by humanity today, including but not limited to UN’s enumerated human rights, could be more deeply implanted in this spiritual foundation.
<P>
Secondly, I think that the United Nations and its various UN agencies, committees and commissions should, in an increasing and disciplined measure, instill their efforts with a systematic concern for the value of human rights.
All their actions should be rooted in, related to, or derived from, the concept of human rights.
This might, perhaps, create a climate in which there would not be so much particularism in the world, so much indifference, so much tolerance for obvious evils, indifference often motivated by egoism or by narrow economic or geopolitical interests.
<P>
To my mind, the biggest problem of today's multipolar world - a world which has witnessed a reawakening of hundreds of atavistic national interests - does not lie in evil as such, but in tolerance for evil.
To give just one example: let us remember how long it took before Europe was able to stop the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
And who knows whether that war would not have continued to this day had not the United States intervened.
<P>
The third remark that I shall make is certainly not new: it is necessary to "debureaucratize" and "deformalize" all of the UN bodies, institutions and procedures and achieve, thusly, substantial cuts in the organization's budget.
Such reform will not only make the UN more efficient in carrying out its vital work, but removing the possibly intimidating face of its bureaucracy might well make the UN itself more effective in the spiritual role of which I have spoken.
<P>
My fourth proposal is this: the United Nations should give thought to restructuring the Security Council, difficult as such reform may be.
In many respects, the present Council is but a relic of post-war circumstances.
I envision a Security Council with a permanent presence of states that have the largest populations, wield the greatest influence and are best equipped to represent the various continents of this world and spheres of its civilization.
Integrated regions, such as Europe, for example, might well be represented by one common representative.
<P>
I also envision a much more flexible decision-making process.
One possible reform in this area might be that the right of veto, which can now be wielded by any one of the five permanent members of the Security Council, would be applicable only when exercised by at least two of the Council’s permanent members.
<P>
Finally, and perhaps most importantly, I think that the United Nations should do everything in its power to see to it that people perceive it as their very own organization, not just as a club of their governments.
Undoubtedly, this perception could be enhanced in a number of different ways.
For example, people could pay the United Nations directly, with the government authorities of their countries just transferring the funds to their destination.
Contributions to the UN would then be contributions of all the inhabitants of this planet, not of governments.
It would be marvelous if every man and woman knew that the UN is truly their organization, even if they paid no more than one millionth of their annual incomes.

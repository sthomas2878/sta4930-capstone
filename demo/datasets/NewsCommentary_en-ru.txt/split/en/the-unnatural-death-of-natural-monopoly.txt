The Unnatural Death of Natural Monopoly
<P>
CHICAGO: The old concept in economics of "natural" monopoly refers to an industry where the technological advantages of large-scale production precludes efficient competition among smaller companies.
The alleged superiority of bigness has been used in many, if not most, countries to justify government ownership of many industries because government monopolies are supposed to better look out for the public interest than private monopolies do.
Although claims about natural monopoly continue to influence public policies and academic discussions, this concept has become largely irrelevant to the dynamic economies of the modern world.
<P>
The growth of global competition implies that even when large scale production is most efficient, companies in small nations are no longer restricted to the inefficiently small scale of their limited domestic market.
They can increase production enormously by operating in several nations, as Chilean electric power companies have raised their profits and expanded production out of their small domestic market by operating in other Latin American countries.
<P>
A more important defect of the natural monopoly argument is its failure to recognize that new technologies often evolve over time that are efficient at much lower levels of output than older methods of production.
For example, small natural gas turbine plants can now generate electricity at lower cost than more traditional and considerably larger coal plants.
Cellular phones unencumbered by a wired grid are competing effectively with traditional wired telephone systems, especially in places, such as most of the postcommunist world, where government owned companies are grossly inefficient.
<P>
A crucial defect of government-run enterprises is that they usually slow down the introduction of these better technologies.
Because such state-owned firms do not have incentives to make profits, they are insulated from competition.
Moreover, they are exposed to political pressures to cater to unions, favored customers, and other groups.
Indeed, despite their mandate to serve the public interest, they have often provided abysmal service to the average customer; in some countries, getting a phone installed has been very expensive, and yet takes months and sometimes years.
<P>
It is these problems with public enterprises which stimulated the revolutionary privatization movement of the past couple of decades.
Nation after nation have at least partially privatized telecommunications, banks, insurance, television transmission, natural gas, airlines, steel and oil
<P>
production, and other industries that in the past were considered natural monopolies.
Newly privatized companies and entrants into formerly closed industries have frequently remarkably improved technologies and service while making good profits, whereas the state monopolies they replaced were often a serious drain on the public treasury.
<P>
However, much remains to be done to allow greater competition into industries like telecommunications and electric power production that had been universally government owned or closely regulated.
Long distance phone service has been opened to vigorous competition in many nations, and this has enormously improved the quality of long distance phoning.
I experienced a clear example of this improvement during a recent trip to Mexico City.
However, local telephone companies are usually still protected from open competition.
<P>
Even if the telephone wire grid that delivers phone service to homes and businesses is considered a natural monopoly, competitors should be allowed to gain a secure access this grid by paying a license fee for its use, which is the way long distance companies already do.
They could then offer local telephone services at unregulated and competitive prices.
<P>
Moreover, even without compulsory licensing, the telephone grid would not be a significant barrier for very long to pricing by competition rather than by government bureaucrats.
Cable companies would convert their wires to offer two way phone service as well as TV programming if they could make profits from local telephone service.
Indeed, they already do this in Great Britain and a few other nations.
<P>
Companies providing cellular and more advanced digital wireless phone service would expand more rapidly to offer vigorous competition to the local phone monopolies.
Some experts estimate that digital wireless could have well over half the phone market in many countries (indeed, in the postcommunist countries digital wireless is growing exponentially, probably because of the abysmal service state telephone monopolies provide) within the next five to ten years, and that they would provide convenient fax, e-mail, internet, and other computer type services.
<P>
The production and transmission of electricity in practically all countries remains under the management of local or national governments.
Yet the development of efficient high voltage transmission lines means that the market for the generation of electric power could transcend local and even national boundaries with free entry and unregulated pricing.
A more open market for electricity would end the sizable regional disparities in the cost of power found in the United States and most other nations, and could strikingly lower the cost to industry and consumers.
<P>
Old concepts in economics die slowly, but the concept of natural monopoly is no longer of much relevance to economic policy.
The sooner we get rid of the idea and the reality, the better off the average consumer and producer will be.

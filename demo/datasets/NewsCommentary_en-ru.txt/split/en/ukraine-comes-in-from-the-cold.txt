Ukraine Comes in From the Cold
<P>
Questions about Ukraine's place in the world have largely been lost in the joyous din of our 'Orange Revolution.'
But Ukraine's born-again democracy obliges us to assume a more exposed role in a complex world: to wonder where and in what sort of Europe Ukraine fits; what balance it should strike between Russia and Europe; and how it should find the self-assurance needed to play its full part in world affairs.
<P>
It would be folly to suggest that Ukrainians start with a blank slate.
Centuries of being part of the Russian and Soviet empires have, in different ways, shaped how Ukrainians view their country and its interests.
<P>
One consequence of this is that Ukrainians are usually shy about asserting Ukraine's independent interests plainly, or expressing national pride.
Politicians here often obscure arguments about foreign policy with cyphers and taboos, and encourage a provincial view of international affairs.
Some prefer to believe that foreign policy is best conducted with our heads in the sand.
<P>
But independence, and the coming of true democracy, made Ukraine into a country like any other.
Most Ukrainians recognize that fact and talk purposefully about their place and role in the world, as nerve wracking as the people who are nostalgic for the Soviet Union find that phenomenon.
<P>
Like any other country, Ukraine's relations with the world are determined by four interlocking factors: history, patriotism, national interests, and geography.
Each factor has special resonance here.
For example, if the broad middle of Ukrainian politics accepts that the national flag must not become the property of nasty nationalists, agreement stops there for the time being because some insist that Ukraine's past contains such confused identities as to deny the chance of real national pride.
<P>
But "past or patriotism" is a false dichotomy.
True, Ukrainians rightly feel (and want to be treated as) a normal independent country.
This does not mean they want to bury history.
We are a normal country with an abnormal history.
<P>
But there are many things in which Ukrainians can and should take pride, among them is our Russo-Ukrainian culture.
Gogol, Bulgarkov, countless others: Russians and Ukrainians are rightly proud of having such giants as their joint heritage.
<P>
Moreover, the use of camouflage in political debate suggests something to hide.
Wrongly.
For despite historyâ€™s long shadow, a close look at Ukraine's national interests reveals no lurking demons.
Ukraine's interests form a comfortingly familiar triangle of economic, political and strategic priorities: free trade and open markets across the globe; prosperous and democratic neighbours; and not being on the front-line of a conflict, still less a potential battleground, between Russia and the West.
A democratic Ukraine located between prosperous like-minded neighbours to east and west is our goal.
<P>
Of course, the risk of tyranny, turmoil and war within what some people call the 'post-Soviet space' looms large, leaving Ukraine keen to prevent deterioration there or at least to limit its vulnerability to repercussions.
Ukrainian enthusiasm for Europe, indeed, is based on the idea that better times always seem to follow for those who join the Union.
Europe's zone of peace and prosperity is a place no sane leader would shun.
<P>
Yet we recognize that few of even the most fervent supporters of European integration today want to help Ukraine quickly become a member.
But the Union can provide immediate help by opening its markets to us.
<P>
More vexing are questions raised by our historic ties to Russia.
In broad terms, Ukraine seeks a secure and stable independence, and it should be remembered that our record here is strong.
Indeed, our decision over a decade ago to surrender Ukraine's status as a nation possessing nuclear weapons is the clearest sign of our responsible behavior.
<P>
Just as we discarded nuclear missiles, some inherited habits of mind also need to be discarded.
One priority is for all Ukrainian politicians to say what they think without code-words and circumlocutions.
Ukrainians, and the rest of the world, have a right to know how Ukrainian leaders see their country's interests and how they propose to satisfy them.
<P>
Straight talk will not make the new Ukraine always obliging or comfortable, but straight talk will be a great deal more productive than polite misunderstandings, and need frighten no one.
For the strong but selfish do not always prevail.
As sumo wrestlers know, weight is not all.
<P>
A different worry is that Ukraine might use the diversity of its interests to avoid hard choices.
But because Americans and Europeans share the Ukrainian habit of seeing world politics in terms of principles (such as democracy and free trade) they can rely on Ukraine as an active partner in the defence of those principles.
<P>
Objectively speaking, Ukraine is more secure as a nation than at any time in its history.
But Ukrainians do not feel that security as they should.
Economic worries, the internal suspiciousness incited by those who sought to divide the country between east and west, Ukrainian-speaker and Russian-speaker, explain most but not all of that uncertainty.
It may in fact be psychologically easier to worry about one big thing (national unity) than lots of small ones.
<P>
But the way to deal with complex situations is to think clearly and act decisively.
That is what Ukrainians will have to do if we are to feel both at home in a transformed Europe and confident enough to play our proper role across the world.

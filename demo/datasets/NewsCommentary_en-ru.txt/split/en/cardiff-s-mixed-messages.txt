Cardiff’s Mixed Messages
<P>
LONDON: The recent European Summit in Cardiff has been widely written off as a non-event, or even, in some quarters, as the beginning of a slow-down in the process of European integration.
In fact, it now seems clear that it marks the moment when the British government seriously wished to be in the single currency.
<P>
It is true that at Cardiff the European heads of government reached no major new decisions of substance, even on those many difficult reforms which will be absolutely required for EU enlargement to the East.
<P>
It is also true that the summit was short of human drama, since it did not even produce a good row.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl had been widely expected to make noisy demands for a cut-back in Germany’s disproportionate role as the paymaster of the Union.
In the event, however, he remained disappointingly quiet.
<P>
In the absence of drama at Cardiff, the most politically-significant event took place immediately before the summit.
For Chancellor Kohl and President Chirac had released a joint letter to their colleagues in which they denounced the idea of a "centrally structured Europe", and called for more "subsidiarity", so as to decentralise decision-making, and take it closer to the citizens of Europe.
<P>
On the day, newspaper headlines tended to interpret this letter as the beginning of a roll-back by France and Germany from their previous commitment to a politically integrated Union.
This interpretation was sedulously kept alive at Cardiff by British officials.
<P>
Tony Blair may be significantly more friendly to the European Union than his Conservative predecessor; but his government is certainly not any kind of fan of political integration in Europe.
And at Cardiff his officials inferred that the Kohl-Chirac letter, and the quietism of the summit itself, both showed that Europe was at last starting to go Britain’s way.
<P>
If this is what they really think, one can only conclude that the British are still having the same old difficulty understanding the dynamic of the European Union.
They have had 25 years’ experience of membership, and by now they ought rationally to know how it works; but it seems that they still do not feel how it works.
<P>
For a quarter of a century, the British have been looking for indication that the European Union might be starting to turn into something like a loose free-trade area; at the very least they have hoped for a halt in the integration process.
As a result, they have difficulty coming to terms with the idea that the essential raison d’Ltre of the European Union is its dynamic towards closer political integration.
<P>
Now there are two messages in the Kohl-Chirac letter.
<P>
The first message, the one which was picked up by newspaper headlines, was a deliberately populist denunciation of the idea of a European mega-state.
Everyone knows that Brussels is not popular, all government leaders agree that the European Union must be made friendlier to the citizen, and none more than Chancellor Kohl, who faces heavy odds in Germany’s parliamentary elections this autumn.
<P>
But the second message is quite different, and it is a straight continuation of the tradition of Franco-German support for closer political integration.
"It is essential", they say, "to enhance European integration and secure the further development and enlargement of the European Union".
<P>
"Our aim", the two leaders continue, "must be to further develop the Political Union in tandem with the Economic and Monetary Union and with a view to the coming enlargement...
In some areas a larger measure of integration is urgently necessary.
This applies especially to the common foreign and security policy".
In addition they call for an action plan for closer integration in interior ministry and judicial affairs.
<P>
The two messages are, of course, complementary.
Unless the European Union can acquire more popular legitimacy, national parliaments are unlikely to agree to more political integration.
But it is simply not true that Kohl and Chirac are calling for a slowdown in integration.
<P>
Similarly with the summit itself.
It is plausible to complain, as many commentators do, that the European Union is taking too long to sort out its essential internal reforms.
But a careful reading of the 39-page final communiqué indicates that the member states are beginning to gather themselves to face these reforms in a systematic way -- but only after the German elections.
<P>
The paradox is that at Cardiff Tony Blair talked more positively about the single currency than he has ever done before; he even sounded almost wistful, as if he wished Britain could have opted to join the other 11 member states in the first wave.
<P>
There are at least two reasons for this change of tone.
The first is that the pound sterling, and the British economy generally, may yet be badly buffeted by the unpredictable repercussions of the financial crisis in Asia; whereas the single currency area may prove a fortress of calm and stability.
<P>
The second reason is that the British government is finding that the economy is proving difficult to manage outside the single currency area, and will get worse.
British inflation is 2-3% higher than in France or Germany.
But British interest rates are four percentage points higher than France or Germany, because the markets distrust the stability of the pound.
One consequence of high interest rates is that the exchange rate of the pound is far higher than the economic fundamentals would justify.
But British inflation is rising, so interest rates will go up, which will keep the pound up.
And yet Britain cannot seriously join the single currency until the pound stabilises at a much lower rate, probably at least 20% lower.
<P>
So how can Tony Blair join the single currency, but wish away the logic of political integration?
He can’t do either of these things.

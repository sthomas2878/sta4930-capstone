Crossing the Euro-Rubicon and Away From Eastward Expansion
<P>
LONDON: By formally opening the European Central Bank in the first week of June, the European Union crossed the Rubicon into Economic and Monetary Union.
The single currency itself – the euro – will be launched on January 1, 1999.
These are major events, since there is no precedent for 11 independent and sovereign countries combining to create a new international currency with a single monetary policy and single monetary authority.
<P>
There is also a growing realisation that more hangs on EMU than the success or failure of a single monetary policy.
For we can now see that the future EU expansion, indeed, of the European Union itself is riding on the success of the single currency.
<P>
If the single currency prospers, the EU will be strengthened and the process of European integration will receive a large new political impulse.
If the single currency were to encounter serious economic and political difficulties, this fact would dominate all the political energies of the participating countries of Euro-land.
And if, by chance, there were to be a breakdown of the single currency, we can be sure in advance that one of the consequences would be that all other strategic choices would be placed on hold.
<P>
Now the most important strategic choice on the EU agenda, after Economic and Monetary Union, is enlargement to central and eastern Europe.
But it is beginning to look likely, perhaps inevitable, that the process of enlargement could be held hostage to the success of the programme for Economic and Monetary Union.
<P>
Many people in the European Union declare in public that enlargement into Central and eastern Europe is a vital and a strategic necessity for the European Union and for the whole of Europe.
Yet everyone knows that enlargement does not command enormous political enthusiasm in the member states.
<P>
One reason for this, no doubt, is anxiety that enlargement entails -- as it must -- some national or sectoral sacrifices of material economic interests; for example in the reform of the structural funds or the common agricultural policy.
But the main reason, I believe, is fear that these sacrifices will come on top of other economic difficulties which may arise as a result of the launch of the Euro, and will be difficult to explain to the voters.
<P>
If EMU is launched successfully, it should give a new economic push to the single market, creating extra jobs and prosperity.
More important, it will also give a large boost to the morale of participating governments, making them more confident in navigating the domestic political shoals of reform.
In addition, a successful EMU will have far-reaching political implications for the European Union and for Europe’s place in the world.
A successful single currency will deliver extra impetus to the dynamic of political integration in the EU, and will strengthen Europe’s role as the holder of a leading international currency on par with the dollar.
<P>
As a result, a successful EMU will also vastly improve the prospects for a successful and harmonious enlargement process.
<P>
But if EMU were to fail, the downside would be great.
For the worst hypothesis is not that EMU will run into some turbulence -- that is more likely than not -- nor that some irresponsible government may weaken EMU’s low-inflation policy, but that the whole system could run into serious economic difficulties, or even fly apart.
If that happened, the EU itself could be at risk.
<P>
This is not to say that EMU is likely to fail.
The 11 participating
<P>
governments obviously think it will succeed, or can be made to succeed, or they would not have made such heroic efforts to qualify for participation in the first wave.
<P>
The problem, for the enlargement process, is that facts are much more important than probabilities.
There may be sound reasons for expecting the single currency to be a great success; and one of the soundest reasons is that the participating governments are determined to make it work.
But we know that the single currency will be an innovation of unprecedented magnitude; and we cannot assume that it will proceed without turbulence, nor exclude the possibility that turbulence will lead to stress, or even to failure.
<P>
The implications are clear.
EU governments are unlikely to commit themselves irrevocably to the enlargement process until they are confident that the single currency has got off to a reasonably good start.
It is hard to predict how long this will take.
Member states may not be in a position to be even provisionally sure that the single currency has started well, until it has been going for at least a couple of years, and most probably not until after the phase-out of national currencies in 2002.
<P>
Does this mean additional delay in the process of EU enlargement?
Not necessarily.
A recent study by the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London predicted that negotiations for the first wave of candidate countries could take between 3 and 7 years, with entry dates between 2002 and 2006, but more likely in the second half of this period.
That analysis suggests that the process might take even longer than that.
<P>
It is starting to be admitted that slowness in the enlargement process, will not just, or even mainly, result from foot-dragging in the European Union.
The central problem is that candidate countries have to make those reforms to their own political, judicial and regulatory institutions, without which they will be unable to join; and that this is itself a process of great difficulty.
<P>
On a recent visit to Poland, the European Commission’s chief negotiator said: “Poland will join when Poland is ready to join.”
But he should have added: “But first the single currency must be successfully launched.”

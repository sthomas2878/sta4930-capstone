Rescuing Georgia
<P>
Georgia will receive its Christmas and New Year's present late this year, but the wait will be worth it.
For the presidential election to choose a successor to President Eduard Shevardnadze, scheduled for January 4, 2004, offers the country its first real hope since independence in 1991.
A peaceful "Rose revolution" brought this about, but economics, not politics, will determine whether Georgia prospers or endures another lost decade.
<P>
Eduard Shevardnadze's time had long since past.
He lifted Georgia out of civil war in the early 1990's, but then held it together by playing one powerful clan off against another.
During his 10 years in power, the economy tanked and hundreds of thousands of his ablest countrymen emigrated.
<P>
Shevardnadze's initial term did bring a liberal foreign investment code and the foundation of a state based on the rule of law.
Investment, particularly in energy, flowed in, as Westen companies hoped that oil and gas deposits in neighboring Azerbaijan meant that there must be some in Georgia, too.
<P>
Shevardnadze also nurtured Georgia's dream to be a transport and energy bridge to the West.
A consortium of international oil companies built the Baku-Supsa pipeline to export Azeri oil to the West through the Black Sea.
Another consortium began to build multi-billion dollar oil and gas pipelines from Azerbaijan through Georgia to Turkey and the West.
<P>
But these investments brought no economic trickle down.
People here survive on a few dollars a day.
The oil and gas pipelines are transport conduits, not real employers.
Moreover, Georgia's reward for providing a strategic export route to the West for Azeri oil was not dollars, but a diplomatic insurance policy - i.e., Western, especially US, concern for the safety of the pipelines.
<P>
Other foreign investors stayed away, because Shevardnadze turned a blind eye to corruption.
Indeed, Transparency International, a watchdog group, calls Georgia one of the 10 most corrupt nations in the world.
The rule of law that Shevardnadze promised existed merely on paper.
<P>
Taking a stand against corruption is a crucial task for the reformist leadership of Mikheil Saakashvili, a Columbia University-educated lawyer, Nino Burjanadze, the acting head of state and speaker of parliament, and Zurab Zhvania, also a former parliamentary speaker.
All are young, highly energetic, and lack Soviet habits.
<P>
Better still, they don't owe anything to Georgia's old power brokers.
Indeed, this group is reminiscent of the young twenty and thirty year olds who took power in Estonia in 1991 and successfully led that former Soviet country into EU membership.
<P>
The primary task they face is to reinvent Georgia as a corruption-free nation.
Otherwise, foreign investors will look elsewhere and domestic investors will continue to hide their money outside the country.
<P>
Those who stole must be prosecuted in order to send a concrete signal that a new era has dawned.
Finally, the monopolistic domestic energy sector must be regulated in fact, not just on paper.
<P>
As important, a bureaucratic meltdown is needed.
Georgia should adopt the Singaporean model and create a small, professional, and (relatively) well-paid administration.
<P>
But paying decent salaries for honest government bureaucrats and judges requires tax revenue.
Value-added tax and other indirect levies must be collected rigorously.
A simple flat-rate income tax would also boost revenues, as it has in Russia.
<P>
More problematic is assuring domestic stability.
Peace must be made with Georgia's three de facto semi-independent regions.
Meaning must be given to the provisions of the Georgian constitution granting these regions autonomous rights.
If this problem is not resolved, foreign investors, let alone tourists, will continue to view Georgia as unstable and stay away.
<P>
Russia remains the key.
As a broker of Shevardnadze's removal, Russia at last appears to be interested in a stable Georgia.
This new Russian concern is a window of opportunity that cannot be lost and should be tested.
But only with American pressure will Russia truly be persuaded to honor its commitments to withdraw its troops from Georgia and disengage from its support of the separatists.
<P>
If Georgia's new leaders fail to revive the country economically, and quickly, then the mythical allure of an authoritarian leader will be enhanced and democracy discredited.
To prevent this will require sustained support from the US and the international community.
<P>
America once again must participate in nation building, and it cannot do so on the cheap.
Georgia simply does not, and cannot, collect sufficient taxes to do the job itself.
It needs international budget support for operations, salaries, and basic services.
This support should be conditioned on demonstrated progress.
A Georgian Marshall Plan, with a strategic economic development plan and specified milestones, holds promise because the government would be able and willing to design and implement a viable program.
<P>
To some donors, Georgia might not seem to be worth the cost.
But a flourishing democracy there will have inevitable spillover effects on Georgia's neighbors, Azerbaijan and Armenia.
What better--and more cost-effective--way to secure the trans-Caucasus pipelines than through democratic legitimacy?
But if Georgians shiver through another energy-less winter in 2004, they could well lose their patience--and their trust in democracy.
<P>
It's that simple.
Georgia can be a democratic domino in the Caucasus, but only with committed international support.
Nation building comes at a price--in time, money, and effort.
There is no shortcut.
The "Rose Revolution" must not be permitted to die on the vine.

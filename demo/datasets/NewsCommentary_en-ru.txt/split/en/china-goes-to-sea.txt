China Goes to Sea
<P>
BRUSSELS – China has traditionally been a continental power, with Asia’s strategic rivalries and relentlessly fluctuating spheres of influence blocking its international ambitions and preventing it from becoming a dominant maritime power beyond the Taiwan Strait.
Or so many have thought.
Nowadays, the People’s Republic is increasingly challenging this view, having shifted its naval strategy from defending its territorial waters to guarding its Pacific frontier and securing its interests overseas.
<P>
Given China’s vast merchant fleet, shipyards in Shanghai and Guangdong have always bustled with activity.
Today, however, the focus is on a new kind of vessel.
Over the course of about a year, China has laid the keels of three advanced destroyers, seven state-of-the art frigates, two large landing platform docks, and, most likely, a new generation of corvettes.
<P>
Add to that the much-publicized launch of the Shi Lang aircraft carrier last year, plus several submarines, replenishment ships, and a sizeable fleet of stealthy missile boats, and it becomes clear that China’s naval aspirations will no longer be confined to its coastal waters.
In fact, the country now builds more surface combat vessels and submarines than its regional counterweight, the United States.
<P>
China long ago abandoned Mao’s effort to reduce the country’s vulnerability by relocating strategic industries to remote provinces.
Today, China considers itself both maritime and continental.
Its coastline, after all, is longer than that of, say, the United Kingdom or India.
These littorals harbor most of the country’s wealth and allow it to tap into the global market via a dense bundle of shipping lines.
<P>
History also looms over China’s maritime ambitions, as memories of more than a century of of foreign transgressions on its territory linger in the minds of contemporary strategists.
Whereas no army can cross the plains of Mongolia or Manchuria, Chinese strategists believe that, until the country establishes itself as a dominant naval power, it will remain vulnerable to the gunboat diplomacy that it experienced in the past.
<P>
But what triggered the sudden acceleration in naval shipbuilding?
First, it was only recently that China gained sufficient confidence in the performance of its new warships.
Second, and more importantly, the new policy reflects mounting fears of a clash over control of the South and East China Seas, as well as a Sino-American showdown over the Taiwan Strait.
<P>
Despite Beijing’s improved relations with Taipei, Chinese strategists largely maintain that as long as the US remains the predominant power in the Western Pacific, China will not escape the threat of naval coercion.
Recent events strengthened this fear.
<P>
Indeed, US officials have successfully portrayed the Chinese navy as increasingly assertive, reinforcing the conviction that America can guarantee its own security only as long as the Pacific remains a buffer against ambitious Asian powers.
But Chinese strategists counter that it is America that is throwing its weight around in East Asia, reinforcing the belief that China will never be secure as long as the US controls the military perimeter that stretches from Japan to Australia.
The Western Pacific is thus poised to become the world’s new center of naval activity, with China and the US locked in a strategic tug of war.
<P>
That struggle is complicated by the virtual impossibility of distinguishing between offensive and defensive intentions.
From China’s perspective, effective defense implies the ability to deter the US navy well beyond Japan and the Philippines – into the wide open of the Pacific Ocean.
This, however, inevitably entails the expansion of China’s sphere of influence.
<P>
China’s naval build-up is also a function of its growing overseas interests, which Chinese President Hu Jintao has publicly described as a priority for the armed forces.
For example, the navy is already protecting shipping lanes from pirates in the Gulf of Aden, and a Chinese warship was dispatched in the Mediterranean to oversee the evacuation of citizens from Libya.
As China prioritizes the development of its long-range sealift capacity, the military is conducting simulations of contingencies like evacuation in hostile conditions and the protection of strategic assets abroad.
The flag will thus certainly follow the trade.
<P>
China’s naval expansion is the product of a deeply entrenched sense of vulnerability, uncertainty about how other powers will react to its rise, and a growing range of threats to its overseas interests.
The trouble remains that the more actively China seeks security, the more it will elicit suspicion from other countries – further augmenting its own fears.
Even in a changed world order, these century-old dilemmas will continue to shape great power politics.

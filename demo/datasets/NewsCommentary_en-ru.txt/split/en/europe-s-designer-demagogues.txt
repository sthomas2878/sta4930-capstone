Europe's Designer Demagogues
<P>
The world needs a Europe committed to internationalism, generous to its former colonies, and willing to absorb its share of migrants and refugees.
But in today's Europe, an successful electoral platform includes shutting out immigrants (especially poor or black ones), abandoning multiculturalism in favor of "cultural integration," limiting access to social welfare, halting or reversing the progress of European unification, and pouring police onto the streets.
<P>
All of this looks like classic right-wing revanchism.
But within, or alongside it, is a new kind of populism, unclassifiable in traditional terms.
<P>
In France, Italy, Holland, Denmark, and Austria, rightist programs have re-shaped national elections and sometimes helped new parties into power.
Through regional legislatures or influence on mainstream parties, the trend extends into Germany and Belgium.
Even in Spain and Britain, where few electorally successful right-wing extremists exist, governments seek to pre-empt them by poaching their policies and their rhetoric.
<P>
The old-style right, with its fascist ancestry, lingers on.
But, as the failure of the Front National in France shows, it cannot break through from posturing to power.
Meanwhile, a new extremism--sleek, trendy, and cool--puts down roots.
Its language is that of the Enlightenment, but made stylish, wired into the Zeitgeist .
The old right can hardly compete; but the establishment can hardly cope.
<P>
The party founded by the flamboyant populist Pim Fortuyn is now the second largest in the Dutch legislature.
Until his assassination, Fortuyn's rise was conspicuous because he flaunted his wealth in the land of "the embarrassment of riches."
He had a Bentley and butler, whereas most Dutch politicians make do with a housewife and a bicycle.
He was showily louche and selectively libertarian, ostentatiously gay and indulgent on drugs.
Branded as a racist, he replied, "I like Moroccan boys: I sleep with them."
<P>
But old right-wing planks formed much of his platform.
Fortuyn proclaimed purity to be in danger: national culture ripe for a restorative purge.
He demanded compulsory re-location of immigrant "ghettos."
Despite his homosexuality, he praised "home values."
He promised "20,000 fewer bureaucrats, 20,000 extra police."
He offered outrage and hope to the traditional far-right constituency.
<P>
And yet Fortuyn's demagogy was both different from and more insidious than the old fascism.
His program spoke to genuine concerns of ordinary people--defending lifestyle-liberalism against religious orthodoxy, for instance; advocating feminism and economic liberalism against benighted prejudices; and strengthening security against terrorism.
But behind it all lurked his misrepresentation of xenophobia as patriotism and his rejection of immigrants, not as black or brown, but as culturally backward.
<P>
In Denmark, the Danish People's Party, which received 12% of the vote in recent elections, similarly resists classification.
Its program of slashing welfare benefits for immigrants is marketed as a "defense of the welfare system" against interlopers.
Prime Minister Rasmussen praises a new ban on foreign spouses as a bulwark against forced marriages.
<P>
What sets the new populism apart are these claims to liberal virtues.
Old-fashioned fascists talked the language of order, so lovers of freedom rallied against them.
The new right talks the language of liberty, and freedom lovers get suckered.
<P>
Little will be genuinely free in a future crafted by these populists: "liberalism" behind barricades; "welfare" that denies the most needy; "tolerance" that allows some to be targets; the un-liberating leader-cults of "noisy little men," their nationalisms and their narrow-mindedness, their police priorities and procrustean plans for "integrating" minorities.
<P>
Of course, a return to the Europe of the 1930s is not in the offing.
The new right accepts capitalism and modernity, and it mostly avoids anti-Semitism.
It is not revolutionary, nor does it preach violence.
But modern does not mean moderate.
The Danish People's Party leadership is frank about its hate-list: "those who betray, who transfer power from Denmark to Brussels, who agree with having a multi-ethnic society."
<P>
These new model nationalists need not win elections to recast Europe.
They exploit electoral systems to enter government with a small share of the vote, or scare mainstream parties into adopting their policies.
After the recent EU summit, JÃ¶rg Haider, leader of Austria's extreme-right Freedom Party, congratulated the Union on copying a stance for which he says he was "labelled racist and fascist."
<P>
An important law of politics is at work here: every integrative process provokes a fissile reaction.
Europeanization stimulates nationalisms.
So the EU can never be safe from a rising right.
But worse still, in troubled times conventional Euro-politicians instinctively reach for consensus, cohabitation, and coziness.
So now the mainstream is re-thinking its policies, aping or assimilating the extremists, hoping to emasculate them by embracing them in government, or luring their votes by imitating their agenda.
<P>
Europe is in for a spell of designer demagogy that thrives in affluence or ennui.
But it must be resisted, because domestic peace depends on mutual respect for cultural plurality, because Europe's changing demographic profile demands more open borders, not a gated continent, and because the new right's inherent chauvinism is irreconcilable with the EU's survival and success.
<P>
The world should not only be worried; it should be watching.
We must choose between a new coziness that includes demagogic populists, or a candor that defies them.

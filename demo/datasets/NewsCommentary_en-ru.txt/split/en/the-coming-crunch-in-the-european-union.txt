The Coming Crunch In The European Union
<P>
LONDON: Europe is heading for a showdown, with France and Germany on one side and Britain on the other, over the European Union's future.
Climax will likely come next spring, but the countdown will begin at the European summit in Dublin on October 5.
<P>
The issue is simple: can France and Germany win sufficient support for a large stride towards a politically more integrated EU; or will Britain, which opposes such moves, succeed in blocking them?
<P>
France, Germany, and their allies have a four-part agenda to:
<P>
1. strengthen EU institutions, with majority voting in the Council of Ministers made easier;
<P>
2. push decisively toward developing common European foreign and defence policies;
<P>
3. bring about European cooperation on issues relating to crime and immigration;
<P>
4. most crucially, devise new legal arrangements that remove, forever, the power of Britain or any other recalcitrant member to obstruct the march of European integration.
<P>
The British, in the name of protecting national sovereignty, oppose all such notions.
In law, the British can hold their ground, because the Franco-German agenda means changing the basic European treaties, and this can only be done if every country agrees.
In political terms, however, the ground is giving way under the British position.
<P>
The struggle between Britain and its European partners over antagonistic visions of Europe has been going on inconclusively for almost 50 years.
Spats, confrontations, and crisis have been numerous.
But the fundamental issues of principle always remained unresolved, because -- until now -- neither side was prepared to push the fight to the limit.
<P>
This hesitancy may be changing.
The stakes are now so high that the struggle may reach a turning point.
It is even possible that there could be a fundamental parting of the ways between Britain and the rest of Europe.
<P>
Some say that this divorce has started.
Five years ago, in the Maastricht Treaty, the 15 EU member states agreed a programme for Economic and Monetary Union in Europe, EMU.
But Britain (and Denmark), in a groundbreaking departure from the principle that all members take part in all common policies, demanded -- and got -- the right to opt out of the final phase of EMU, the single currency.
<P>
The paradox is that, despite Britain's opt-out, EMU is turning out to be the detonator of the decisive political clash now brewing.
The French, and the Germans (though the latter less willingly), have made the achievement of monetary union the foundation of their EU strategy.
The problem is that neither France nor Germany can be certain that they will be able to pass the budgetary tests so as to launch the single currency on schedule.
<P>
If either were to fail these tests, monetary union would be stillborn.
This would setback not only the EU, but also wound the strategic partnership between France and Germany that has been at the heart of European diplomacy since the days of Adenauer and de Gaulle.
Over the past 15 years, indeed, all significant progress by the EU has been driven by this partnership.
<P>
For these reasons, it is now certain that France Germany will strain every nerve and sinew to meet the EMU timetable.
Some observers believe they will bend the rules rather than fail the test.
<P>
But until EMU actually happens, there remains uncertainty about whether it can be achieved on schedule.
This means that both France and Germany now attach a colossal premium to the success of the up-coming negotiations for reforming the political dimensions of the EU.
For if EMU were to be derailed, even temporarily, it would be vital for the Franco-German partnership, and for the credibility of the EU, that there should be compensating political progress towards a more integrated Europe.
<P>
The force of this political calculus has been charged by the dynamics of the electoral cycle in France, Germany and Britain.
Above all in France, because there is a real possibility that the present conservative government could be thrown out of power by a socialist victory in the parliamentary elections in the spring of 1998.
<P>
What that would mean for EMU is now incalculable.
Unless a big recovery of the French economy occurs, with a significant fall in the unemployment rate, any incoming French socialist government would be under pressure to launch an expansive budgetary policy, which might be incompatible with monetary union in Europe.
<P>
This is why President Jacques Chirca is pushing hard on the fast-forward pedal in the current negotiations to revise the EU treaty.
He cannot be sure that France will pass the test for monetary union on time.
He cannot be sure that the socialists will not win power in 1998.
He cannot be sure that they will not repudiate the heart of the Franco-German bargain.
<P>
So, as insurance and in advance, he must seal the Franco-German bargain with a deal on a set of parallel political initiatives for European integration.
This means ratifying a new treaty on European political integration before the 1998 elections, probably by the middle of next year.
To achieve this Chirac must force a reckoning on the most difficult, neuralgic issues facing the EU right away.
<P>
The fact that President Chirac needs a certain set of results does not, of course, mean that he will get them.
What it does mean is that, whereas for the past 25 years France and Germany usually saw their interest in trying to finesse or wait out British obstructions, today they may see a common interest in forcing a final showdown.
Not only may British membership be at stake, but the very future and nature of the EU.

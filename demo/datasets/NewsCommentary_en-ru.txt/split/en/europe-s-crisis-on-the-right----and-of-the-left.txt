Europe’s Crisis on the Right -- and of the Left
<P>
LONDON: French politics has been rocked to its foundations by the spectre of a rapprochement between its traditional conservative parties and the ultra-right-wing Front National of Jean-Marie Le Pen.
Across Europe, mainstream conservatives will be watching this dance nervously over the coming weeks and months.
For French conservatives are not alone in fearing that bumptious nationalist/anti-European movements are outflanking them on the right.
<P>
With regular scores of 14-15% of the national vote, the xenophobic and anti-European Front National has become a durable factor of French politics.
Until now, it has been denied an effective national political role, because it has been quarantined by respectable conservative parties, who enforced a generally effective taboo against dealing with the Front.
<P>
That taboo disintegrated after the March regional elections in France.
At first, the Socialists and their allies seemed to have done rather well, by pulling ahead in 10 of the 21 regions, compared with seven where the conventional right were ahead, and four where the result was neck-and-neck.
Uproar broke out when five local conservative barons sought to hang onto control of their regions by accepting the National Front’s support.
<P>
All five were immediately suspended by their national party headquarters.
Too late, the damage was done.
The taboo against collaboration with the National Front was officially reaffirmed, but in reality it has been seriously weakened.
<P>
So, what does it mean?
If we are looking at the prospect of a further consolidation of the strength of the Front National, is this an essentially French event?
If so, it would set France even further apart from its European neighbours, for it is currently the only leading European country with a large and apparently durable ultra-right-wing party.
Or is it, on the contrary, a phenomenon with wider European significance?
<P>
At one level, the drama is purely French.
The rise of the Front National can be interpreted as a series of protests: against the long recession from which France is only now emerging; against open markets and trade liberalisation in Europe; against Europe’s upcoming single currency, and the fiscal belt-tightening that has gone with it; and against global markets and economic restructuring, which have contributed to the rise in unemployment, now standing around 122% of workers.
All these partial explanations are probably true.
<P>
But the Front National would probably not have gotten as far as it has, were it not for the divisions and weaknesses of the French right.
France has never had a single large mainstream conservative party, like Britain’s Conservatives or Germany’s Christian Democrats.
Instead, there has been a plethora of middling parties.
The largest is the Gaullist RPR party; but since it tries to draw its main inspiration from the ideas of General Charles de Gaulle, who died nearly 30 years ago, it has difficulty devising a plausible identity for itself.
(The other main grouping is the Union for French Democracy (UDF); but it, too, is divided into smaller sub-groups.)
<P>
Being so divided, French conservatives cannot tell a coherent story about the current phase of European integration, about market liberalisation, or about economic restructuring.
Some bits of the UDF are ostensibly in favour of market liberalisation and European integration; yet all five of the would-be collaborators with the FN came from the UDF.
The Gaullists are more disciplined against collaborating with the FN; but many of them are hostile to liberalisation and European integration.
<P>
In a world increasingly dominated by the forces of free markets, France may be naturally fertile ground for a Front National phenomenon.
Under former President Mitterrand, France seemed a champion of European integration and even, at a pinch, of trade liberalisation.
But the French people manifestly still believe in the power of the state to make things happen; so when things go wrong, they demonstrate in the streets; and, come election time, they vote for a protest party.
<P>
Some commentators argue that the French Front National problem is symptomatic of a general European problem of the right.
After all, Chirac’s Gaullists are not the only right-wing group with an incoherent ideology calling for both liberalization and statism simultaneously.
They point to the resurgence of social democracy in Britain, France, Italy and (possibly later this year) Germany, as a reflection of this.
<P>
In fact, we may be looking at an even more general European phenomenon, which is a reflection of the rising challenges of European integration: the single currency, and enlargement into Eastern Europe.
This makes it difficult for right-wing parties to combine their usual rhetoric of economic liberalism with nationalism; or for left-wing parties to reconcile their traditional preferences of internationalism and statism.
<P>
But the heart of the problem may be the unfolding of a general crisis of parliamentary democracy in Europe.
Essentially, parliamentary democracy depends on having (at least) two political parties, each of which has a coherent and explicit programme of government.
But in the closing years of the 20th Century, no political party, either of right or left, has a coherent and explicit programme of government.
<P>
Traditional socialism, with its promise of the benevolent power of the state, has vanished beyond recall; and so has the infinite reassurance of the welfare state, which was supposed to protect against all adversity; and so has the paradigm of Keynesian demand management, with its promise of guaranteed employment and prosperity.
<P>
Instead, parliamentary democracy is giving way to the politics of populism, personality and presidentialism; in short, to Hollywood and TV.
<P>
If this is the pattern of the future, it may have serious dangers for the European enterprise.
For the implication is that right-wing populist parties, like the Front National and its equivalents in Austria, Italy, Denmark and elsewhere may do better in future, not worse, particularly if monetary union prolongs the economic pain and uncertainty that large groups within all electorates are now feeling.

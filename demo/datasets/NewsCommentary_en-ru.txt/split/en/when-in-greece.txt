When in Greece
<P>
ATHENS – Italian President Mario Monti, US President Barack Obama, and other leaders have declared, “We are not Greece,” in order to explain why their countries are not on the brink of financial collapse.
A few months earlier, Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou announced, “We are not India,” to explain why Greece will not become a country of cheap labor.
<P>
These types of remarks are based on stereotypes, which can be useful despite their often discriminatory bias.
In fact, stereotypes can help us to make sense of the world and take swift decisions, but they can also lead to errors in judgment.
<P>
The comments about Greece and India are disturbing not merely because they employ stereotypes that risk mangling facts, but also because they use stereotypes as a way to explain a country’s collective failures.
It is not the assertion that “Greeks are all bankrupt” that is troubling, but rather the idea that “Greeks are bankrupt because they are Greeks.”
The implication is that Greece has certain inherent characteristics that cause its financial problems, or that India possesses a trait that inevitably results in low wages – a trait that other countries are lucky not to possess.
<P>
This type of reasoning, referred to as “essentialism,” has been a subject of philosophical investigation for centuries, as well as a topic of psychological research in the last few decades.
Essentialism is the view that people and objects have inner and unchangeable essences that determine their characteristics.
<P>
This view is not always wrong.
Gold has a certain chemical property that makes it glitter, and water comprises substances that account for the way it flows.
Applying this reasoning to countries, however, is problematic.
<P>
Countries, unlike metals or fluids, are human constructs.
They are conceptual realities that have emerged from human intellect and behavior.
As constantly evolving organisms, there is nothing empirically inherent in countries’ characteristics.
<P>
Of course, it is true that citizens within countries often exhibit shared traits.
An individual’s citizenship can help us to make guesses about their values or behavior, which are shaped by sociological, anthropological, and psychological influences.
Nevertheless, by default, essentialism precludes an examination of the actual origins of these traits by taking for granted that groups or countries exhibit certain characteristics simply because that is “how they are.”
<P>
Recent worldwide “We are all Greeks” demonstrations were staged to protest against the stereotype that Greeks are lazy and would rather enjoy the sun than go to work.
But there is also a more fundamental aspect of this movement – refuting the idea that Greeks have a mysterious inherent property that differentiates them from other human beings.
In a metaphorical sense, we are all Greek, just as we are all Indian, American, or Italian.
<P>
In circumstances as complicated as Greece’s economic crisis, it is facile to explain the country’s woes by declaring, “They are Greeks.”
And it is equally simplistic to say, “We are not Greece,” to explain one’s own relative economic stability.
<P>
Psychological and sociological research demonstrates that people use essentialist reasoning strategically to normalize status inequality and present group differences as natural.
It is therefore understandable that political leaders would deploy such reasoning to emphasize differences and protect their countries’ narrow interests.
<P>
Essentialism lowers the level of political discourse by engaging in one-dimensional stereotypes.
But the approach is tempting, because it offers leaders easy explanations for badly managed conflicts, and allows them to establish hierarchies of status based on unidentified properties, which are typically used to justify inequality or injustice.
<P>
Citizens weary of hackneyed essentialist stereotypes as a substitute for serious analysis must challenge these ideas.
The claim that Greeks love the sun is not a sufficient explanation for why the country is on the brink of financial collapse.
And declaring, “We are not Greece,” is not enough to protect other countries from their own potential crises.

The Fed’s Scylla and Charybdis
<P>
TILBURG – While the advanced economies have been struggling through the worst economic crisis in decades, their central banks have had it easy.
After all, when faced with falling GDP growth, a financial system on the verge of collapse, plummeting real-estate prices, and a lack of consumer confidence, the needed monetary-policy response is clear: keep lowering nominal interest rates until they reach the zero bound, then pull out the big, unconventional guns.
<P>
But, for the US Federal Reserve, the easy part is over.
<P>
When the Fed launched its first round of quantitative easing (QE) – large-scale purchases of long-term financial assets – in 2009, policymakers declared that the goal was to kick-start the US economy.
Once that was achieved, the Fed vowed, it would terminate the scheme.
Now, with the US economy growing at a steady annual rate of roughly 2%, real-estate prices rising, consumer confidence at a six-year high, and gradual recovery in the labor market, the time has come for the Fed to follow through on its promise.
<P>
To be sure, the US economy is not performing at pre-crisis levels.
But recent developments herald the “post-crisis” era – and that means that QE’s objective has been fulfilled.
To use former Fed Chairman William McChesney Martin’s metaphor, the party has gotten going again, so the Fed must take away the punch bowl.
<P>
But this is easier said than done, given that America’s government, financial markets, and consumers have become addicted to rock-bottom interest rates.
As a result, just as Odysseus was forced to choose between facing Scylla, a six-headed monster, and Charybdis, a deadly whirlpool, in Homer’s Odyssey, the Fed must take action knowing that whichever course it chooses could have serious adverse consequences – and thus will probably be considered the wrong move.
<P>
If the Fed keeps its word and begins to formulate an exit strategy, it risks derailing the recovery.
The normalization of monetary policy will lead to the normalization of long-term interest rates, bringing the nominal interest rate on US ten-year government bonds to at least 5%.
<P>
Given this, as soon as the Fed begins to withdraw from QE, it can expect pressure from Congress, the White House, consumers, and companies to intensify considerably.
Worse, financial markets, anticipating that a slower recovery will impair America’s ability to finance its budget deficit, could demand a risk premium on US government debt, forcing policymakers to revive the contentious debt-ceiling debate.
This is the Fed’s Scylla.
<P>
The alternative would be for the Fed to decide – whether on its own or in response to external pressure – that it is too soon to initiate an exit from QE.
But more QE would fuel inflation expectations, pushing up long-term interest rates.
Meet the Fed’s Charybdis.
<P>
In theory, the Fed could try to navigate between the two hazards by using “forward guidance” – that is, by signaling to financial markets well in advance how and when it will initiate its policy change.
But this route is likely to be too narrow to avoid both threats successfully, especially given the complex nature of a QE exit.
<P>
Indeed, forward guidance works well in areas – like inflation targeting – that depend on only one indicator.
By contrast, an exit from QE must account for many factors, including GDP growth, inflation, and unemployment.
As a result, the time frame and exit route would be subject to change with each new set of macroeconomic data – rendering the very concept of forward guidance useless.
In fact, the approach could even exacerbate market uncertainty.
<P>
The Fed has a difficult decision to make – one that involves significant risk.
And, sooner or later, other advanced-country central banks will face a similar dilemma.
Far from being over, the crisis is entering a new and dangerous phase.

Belindia Has Spoken
<P>
SANTIAGO – Forty years ago, the Brazilian economist Edmar Bacha named his country Belindia: a combination of prosperous and modern Belgium and poor and backward India.
In last Sunday’s presidential election, according to many observers, the Indian part of Brazil voted for the incumbent, President Dilma Rousseff, and the Belgian part voted for the social democrat Aécio Neves.
India is larger, so Rousseff won.
<P>
This is fast becoming the standard account of Brazil’s election, the most acrimonious and hotly contested in recent memory.
And it is easy to see why.
In Brazil’s underdeveloped Nordeste, Dilma (in Brazil, politicians, like footballers, go by their first name) swept the vote.
<P>
In the relatively rich South, which accounts for 70% of Brazil’s economic output, Aécio won handily.
Similar divisions appear when voters are classified according to dependence on government handouts (high in the Northeast) or years of schooling (high in the South).
<P>
Yet there is more to this election than this broad-brush picture suggests.
In 1974, when Bacha coined his term, it went without saying that the prosperous and modern Brazil was just a tiny sliver of the total.
In 2014, Neves, the candidate of “Belgian” Brazil, won more than 48% of the vote.
<P>
That reveals how much the country has changed in the last four decades, and how large and influential its middle class has become.
It was precisely that middle class, fed up with allegations of corruption and a sluggish economy, that turned against the ruling Workers’ Party (PT) and voted for change.
<P>
But it is also striking that despite the weak economy – growth will barely average 1.5% during Rousseff’s first term, and the economy is now in a technical recession, having contracted in two consecutive quarters – Dilma and the PT managed to retain the support of Brazil’s tens of millions of poor and excluded citizens.
This is partly because the recession has not made a big dent in employment, which means that many households have yet to feel the impact.
<P>
Dilma was also helped by the commodity super-cycle, which filled Brazil’s coffers and made it possible to run ambitious cash-transfer programs that helped pull countless families out of poverty.
These policies were actually launched by former President Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Neves’s Party of Brazilian Social Democracy (PSDB), but are associated in the popular imagination with Dilma’s political mentor and predecessor, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, also of the PT.
By claiming (with no evidence) that Aécio would cut these popular programs, Dilma dealt the PSDB a sharp electoral blow.
<P>
Using commodity revenues to obtain political support is not a strategy unique to Brazil.
In Argentina, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Venezuela, populists have tried the same trick.
So have the vastly different governments of the conservative Sebastián Piñera and the socialist Michelle Bachelet in Chile.
And the similarities do not end there.
<P>
Now that the commodity boom is ending, all of these countries face the challenge of building a new economic engine to sustain growth and create jobs.
Without the commodity windfall, they must develop new sectors that can produce new goods and services, requiring new sets of skills and new types of infrastructure.
<P>
This is a tall order, especially for Brazil.
The structural deficiencies of its economy have long been understood, but little has been done to correct them.
Brazil has South America’s biggest government (with a tax take exceeding one-third of GDP), yet the authorities save and invest too little, which creates both micro- and macroeconomic problems.
<P>
On the micro side, too little public investment means poor infrastructure and high export costs.
Brazil has none of neighboring Argentina’s hefty export taxes, but its heavy transport costs have the same effect.
<P>
Education, too, receives little public funding, especially at the pre-school and primary levels.
Like Chile, Brazil has sharply increased school enrollment but has yet to provide high-quality learning opportunities to disadvantaged children.
In the OECD’s international PISA rankings of educational achievement, Brazil places near the bottom, below Mexico and Chile.
<P>
On the macro side, too little public savings means insufficient savings at the national level.
When international funds are available, this produces short-lived booms and large current-account deficits, financed by heavy external borrowing.
When international liquidity dries up, as it often does for Brazil and Latin America, weak domestic investment and sluggish growth follow.
<P>
Neves had a plan to address these shortcomings.
Dilma does not.
Her election-night speech was full of calls for unity and dialogue, and included a pledge to “take urgent action” to resume growth.
But, like her campaign, the speech was short on specifics.
<P>
On industrial policy, the PT has the right intuition but the wrong tools.
Partnering with leading domestic sectors to promote innovation is one thing; doing so through price controls (as with fuels), indiscriminate subsidies, and protectionism is another.
In recent years, Brazil has taken the latter route.
<P>
Rousseff has little time to waste.
She will govern a country with substantial public debt (60% of GDP), a volatile currency, and high inflation.
Nervous financial markets will keep the government on a tight leash.
<P>
Neves and his PSDB have come out of this election considerably strengthened, but they also will face difficult challenges in the coming years.
The social democrats will have a larger delegation in Congress (including Neves himself in the Senate) and will govern some of Brazil’s larger states, including São Paulo, home to 43 million people and one-third of the country’s GDP.
But to reach the Planalto Presidential Palace after the 2018 election, the PSDB will have to convince poor Brazilians – those living in Bacha’s India – that it works on their behalf, and that the policies it advocates benefit them the most.
<P>
Then, and only then, will Brazil’s longstanding divisions begin to heal.
When they do, the country will get the modern and effective social-democratic government that it deserves.

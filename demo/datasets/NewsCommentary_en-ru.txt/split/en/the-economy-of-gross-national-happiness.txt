The Economy of Gross National Happiness
<P>
OXFORD – On April 2, the United Nations hosted a High-Level Meeting on Happiness and Well-Being in New York.
Conceived by the government of the Kingdom of Bhutan, and supported by 68 UN member states, the meeting was conducted against the tumultuous backdrop of global financial crisis, catastrophic climate change, widespread poverty, and the rise of neuroeconomics – factors that have jolted the status quo and brought economics to a crossroads.
<P>
The meeting was called to catalyze mounting efforts to create a new economic paradigm grounded in sustainability and dedicated to human well-being, building on Bhutan’s innovative approach, which aims not for GDP growth, but for gains in gross national happiness (GNH).
Bhutan’s holistic approach takes into account material, social, spiritual, and environmental factors, measured according to the GNH index.
<P>
Indeed, Bhutan’s example gives the international community a unique opportunity to reconsider the path of economics in order to facilitate human flourishing on a shared planet.
Three topics must be addressed to drive the discussion forward.
<P>
First, the focus must be on the big picture.
For too long, economics has ignored ethical considerations.
As Tony Atkinson points out in his article “The Strange Disappearance of Welfare Economics,” economic analysis must take into account how proposed policies help people to thrive.
Today, as governments around the world cut their budgets, the need for a clear moral basis for economic policymaking is more pressing than ever.
<P>
This in no way undercuts the priority that must always be given to eradicating poverty and destitution.
On the contrary, because effective responses to poverty require a sustained focus on social movements, cultural and environmental concerns, and political leadership, attention to human well-being can play an important part in reducing material disadvantage.
<P>
The economist and philosopher Amartya Sen has long argued that markets, trade, and economic growth should be designed explicitly to advance human well-being.
Economic growth is a means; human welfare is the end.
The time is ripe for political leaders and civil-society groups to demand that economists consider climate change and wider aspects of well-being, alongside growth and financial stability.
Discussing a wider set of indicators – one that better reflects fundamental goals – is the place to start.
<P>
Second, with a new economic model must come new economic tools, including policy models that enable policymakers to advance their objectives effectively and means of measuring progress.
<P>
The Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress, convened in 2008 by French President Nicolas Sarkozy, reflected the public’s hunger for more accurate statistics and metrics that matter.
Last year’s adoption by the UN General Assembly of a resolution entitled “Happiness: Towards a holistic approach to development,” introduced by Bhutan and supported by 68 countries, reveals that this hunger is greater than ever.
<P>
At the same time, multidimensional measures are growing in both rigor and acceptance, owing to timely data collection, intensive research, and new and emerging methodologies.
Developing the appropriate economic-policy framework must follow.
<P>
A new commission established by Bhutan, to be chaired by its prime minister, should generate the technical tools needed to orient economics to human well-being on a shared planet.
It may start with metrics, and continue to policy.
The time is ripe to gather and coordinate recent economic insights on motivation, preferences, measurement, and modeling, and lay the groundwork for systematic, rather than symptomatic, change.
<P>
Above all, ordinary people must call for systemic change.
As MIT’s Daron Acemoglu wrote of economists after the 2008 financial crisis in the United States, “we let policies and rhetoric set the agenda for our thinking about the world and, worse, perhaps, even for our policy advice.”
The British economist Nicholas Stern went so far as to claim that his colleagues had become the slaves of defunct politicians.
Both economists acknowledge that leadership must come not from politicians or the academy, but from the broader public.
<P>
The question that must be answered is how NGOs, faith communities, the media, bloggers, and citizens can help to set a new economic agenda, create political space for innovation, and maintain the demand for progress.
<P>
The government and people of Bhutan are showing the world the way.
The GNH index and policy tools have helped to turn the notion of measuring and maximizing human well-being into an operational concept.
Following Bhutan’s lead, the international community must support the commission to hammer out the details of the measures, accounts, and financial mechanisms required for a new economic model based on the well-being of all of the planet’s citizens.
<P>
Economics is poised to change, but how is not yet clear.
What is clear is that moral and intellectual leadership is essential.
Bhutan’s new commission provides an invaluable opportunity to begin constructing a roadmap for a new multidimensional model of sustainable welfare economics, founded in human well-being.

Why The European Union Has No Foreign Policy
<P>
LONDON: Britain’s Labour government reacted to the crisis in Kosovo by coming out in favour of a stronger defence role for the European Union.
The lesson of Kosovo, said Prime MinisterTony Blair, was that Europe "must speak coherently on foreign and security policy".
<P>
The need is long overdue.
Europe’s incapacity to act coherently in foreign policy is a glaring shortcoming, and it became a source of scandal and shame when the EU failed to intervene effectively in the war in Yugoslavia.
The Kosovo tragedy is yet another reminder that the Europeans never seem to get their act together.
<P>
Why is this so?
Some say it is a question of nationalism: the French or the British are reluctant to subordinate national to European interests.
Others say that Europe can hardly have a single foreign and defence policy when four of its members are neutral.
A third explanation, often advanced by Americans, blames moral and political cowardice: the Europeans are as numerous as the Americans and nearly as rich, yet they prefer to shirk their international responsibilities, freeloading on their American allies.
<P>
There is something in all three points.
But they do not tell the whole story.
First, member states say they want to develop a common European foreign policy.
At Maastricht in 1991, they set up new institutions for doing so; and at Amsterdam last year, they ostensibly strengthened those institutions.
Yet in practice there has been no detectable progress.
<P>
This is in stark contrast with other aspects of the European Union agenda.
The target of Economic and Monetary Union and a single currency, which was also adopted at Maastricht in 1991, is a bold, even revolutionary programme; some critics say reckless; but the fact is that the single currency will be a reality in just two months’ time.
Where EMU is concerned, nobody can accuse the member states of being cowardly or dilatory.
<P>
Some people hope Europe’s foreign policy failure is a temporary phenomenon, which could be solved by one more heave, or perhaps by some real leadership from Germany or France.
<P>
It seems more likely that the problem is structural, and lies in the profound systemic differences between the process of internal (mainly economic) integration, and the process of external (mainly political) integration.
If these differences do explain why there has been much more progress in the first category than in the second, then Europe’s foreign policy failure may last a long while.
<P>
The process of internal (mainly economic) integration has six distinct ingredients:
<P>
* A closed system, with a known set of participating countries;
<P>
* the concerted choice of discrete policy areas for integration;
<P>
* the negotiation of explicit bargains with predictable consequences;
<P>
* the option of off-setting side bargains;
<P>
* the enactment of these bargains in legislation;
<P>
* the "justiciability"of these bargains before the European Court of Justice.
<P>
What unifies these ingredients is the key characteristic of predictability.
In the integration process, governments believe they know what they are doing, they believe they have discrete choices, they believe they can broadly predict the consequences of the bargain being offered, and if they step forward, it is because they believe the bargain will be advantageous.
<P>
None of these ingredients are present in the process of foreign (mainly political) integration.
Governments are not dealing with a closed system, they cannot determine the outside participants, they cannot determine which policies will affect them, they mostly cannot formulate bargains in legislation (= treaties), and they mostly will have no court to appeal to.
<P>
So the key characteristic of foreign policy integration is that governments cannot know in advance what they are letting themselves in for.
In the case of defence and warfare, unpredictability includes the possibility of young men dying in action.
It is not surprising, therefore, that foreign policy integration has not made much progress.
<P>
This contrast underlines the fact that the great achievements of EU integration have taken place in that no-man’s-land which lies between complete national independence and a complete loss of sovereignty in a federation.
But foreign policy, as we have known it, is essentially a manifestation of the nation state or of the superpower.
<P>
Of course, "foreign policy" is a loose term with many meanings.
Cultural diplomacy lies at one end, military and defence policy at the other, with aid and trade policy in the middle.
<P>
The EU is rather effective at the softer end of foreign policy, such as culture, trade and aid.
For these are the areas of foreign policy which come closest to containing the six essential ingredients of predictability.
<P>
Europe’s failure lies exclusively at the power end of the range, with defence and military policy.
This is consistent with the EU’s key characteristic as the world’s first great "Civilian Power".
<P>
Will the picture change after enlargement to Central and Eastern Europe?
Some say that a common foreign policy will be even more difficult for a Union of 20-25 than for a Union of 15.
Yet it is equally arguable that enlargement right up to the fringes of Russia, will compel more foreign policy co-ordination.
<P>
Enlargement of the EU into Central Europe is itself a colossal act of geo-strategic policy.
For that very reason it is still uncertain whether it will ever happen, despite the rhetoric of some of Europe’s political leaders.
If it does, it will be a transforming event of grand strategy, beside which Desert Storm will seem to be just a temper tantrum of a technocratic adolescent with hi-tech toys.
<P>
The EU will need a great deal more integration, perhaps until it becomes a centralised mega-state, before it is likely to operate a grand foreign policy and military strategy in the conventional American sense.

A Golden Age For Capitalism?
<P>
CAMBRIDGE: Two views of the world economy exist today.
One proclaims a new golden age, akin to the late 19th century when capitalism blossomed.
The other says capitalism has run its course, not on its ability to produce but as a socially acceptable process for governing human relations in the market.
The first is attractive to an economist for whom the spread of markets foreshadow a pattern of prosperity and progress.
The latter view is heard from those who feel that capitalism has won on production but lost on equity; they believe mankind should find a new mode of sharing.
An elevating thought, but it is not around the corner.
So focus on what is at hand, namely unprecedented scope for capitalism.
<P>
The late 19th century ushered in the beginning of freedom of movement for both people and capital.
Joseph Schumpeter, whose analysis of capitalist development focused on "creative destruction" recognized that when an old world breaks down, growth potential is mobilized everywhere and new structures emerge that can incite a large, protracted growth spurt.
<P>
The world today has moved into such a Schumpeterian opportunity.
The immediate reasons are fourfold:
<P>
 dramatic improvement in technology that brings an overwhelming change in communications possibilities thereby shrinking distances to nothing;
<P>
 the end of communism and emergence of new markets and the abandonment of traditional priorities and alliances;
<P>
 the deterioration of statist-corporatist structures embodied in the welfare state and pervasive regulation in Europe but also in much of the developing world.
<P>
 sinflation's end among the major industrialized countries.
<P>
This quadruple source of change will leave no stone unturned in the world economy.
New countries, industries, and people will come to the top.
The chances of emerging with a far richer world (not with less inequality, though) are outstanding.
<P>
An immediate way of recognizing that something different is afoot is the US stock market.
The favorable environment spelled out above is captured in today's record stock prices.
There are sound reasons for this market optimism: investors do not need to fear inflation.
In the developed world there has been no inflation for a decade.
That is new; in the past, central banks would bring down growth to stop economic overheating going too far.
<P>
This implies the stock holder keeps more of his money, less is wasted in recessions.
Massive corporate restructuring goes the same way: it takes money wasted by overstaffing or outmoded technologies and locations.
Streamlining increases profits for the stock holder, stocks should be high.
Finally, governments belatedly have become business-friendly.
They understand that companies can move; to keep the jobs, the stock holder has to be treated with kid gloves.
<P>
Of course, even if stocks take a dip there is a silver lining.
Anyone who looks back to the 1987 crash must surely remember this: the biggest mistake was not to have bought by the end of day 2.
The lesson is clear, buy in!
<P>
Reasons for an extended period of prosperity are real: free trade around the world, mobilizing upward of 2 billion people to move out of closed, repressed markets to seek their future and fortune in world trade; unprecedented mobility of ideas, benchmarking by world class standards; spread of technologies and money to the most remote parts of the world.
<P>
The old world is rapidly being eclipsed by growth in Asia.
In the 20 years to come, more than two-thirds of the extra output produced in the world will be in emerging economies, most in Asia.
<P>
Where are the set backs that could disturb an exciting vision.
One issue is that Europe and Japan trip up.
The battle over monetary union is one of the genuinely bad ideas in European history; true, budgets must be cut in order for countries to join the single currency, but such cuts will come all at once and in haste without an accommodating monetary expansion.
This seems a prescription for slowdown.
In the end, restructuring begets growth, but only if the monetary authorities are willing accomplices.
<P>
Another risk is that myriad opportunities for investment produce an all-out capital shortage.
High real rates and bad credits will likely be the result.
That risk is surely exaggerated.
Much could be done to build up China, Asia or the entire emerging world.
But without institutions in place and thorough assurances of property rights, development will take decades.
The need for investment is large and urgent, but the pace will be moderate.
<P>
In the 19th century infra-structure drew investment on an extraordinary scale.
Yet, no capital shortage ever became apparent.
<P>
A third risk is political: too much capitalism, too many new players making it, too many old and slow players falling by the way side.
That is a recipe for backlash.
In the United States, where restructuring and competition have been most vigorous, this is rarely apparent.
Governments are mostly bankrupt; a stabilizing factor.
It throws more burden on the individual.
When Britain's labor leader was asked what to do about unemployment and jobs, his answer was that people must work on their employability.
A refreshing turn that marks the spirit of the end of this century.
<P>
The great opportunities of the 19th century were squashed by mad nationalism and the emergence of an all-powerful state regimenting economic activity.
Today, with peace, the old powers are tired of struggle and new ones are not ready.
This is the greatest assurance of a window of opportunity for major world development in a free, open and competitive world economy.

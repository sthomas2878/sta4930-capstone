Iran Looks Outwards
<P>
WASHINGTON D.C.: Since the demise of the Soviet Union, the Islamic Republic of Iran has aggressively fostered a new set of regional alliances with Muslim neighbors, especially along its 1,400 kilometer northern border.
In stark contrast to the theocracy’s first decade, today the ruling clergy’s focus is not on exporting Islamic zealotry or political revolution.
The primary goals are now economic, reflecting growing pressures and priorities inside Iran as well as the shifting measure of power worldwide.
<P>
Ideally, Iran would like to become a hub — and perhaps the center — of Central Asia, providing communications, infrastructure, expertise and a major international airport and other transportation links.
"We now see a predominant tendency worldwide towards regionalism.
And this is now very much present in Iran," said Mohammed Javad Zarif, Iran’s deputy foreign minister, in an interview.
This role also plays to Iran’s historic strengths as a land of bazaaris, one of the three pillars of society, along with the military and clergy.
<P>
Iran’s regional focus is typified several ways.
<P>
The first is development of a transport system — both railways and roads — that will connect the once disparate parts of the region.
A new multi-billion dollar network, when completed, will link Iran’s Persian Gulf ports with Central Asia and in turn hook up with Russian and Chinese transportation systems.
Eventually, it will stretch from the oil and import/export center of Bandar Abbas in southwest Iran all the way across the continent to Shanghai.
Iran is also expected to eventually create new trade routes spanning the Mediterranean through the Indian Ocean all the way to the Sea of Japan and the Pacific, according to diplomats and economists in Tehran.
<P>
Four rail links, some with new road to the side, are now planned or already under construction.
They include:
<P>
• A 266 kilometer railway link from the eastern Iranian city of Mashad to the Turkmenistan border, which will then hook into the old Soviet railway system and then into China’s railway.
Scheduled to be completed next year, it will also give Central Asian exporters a greatly shortened route to Europe.
Moreover, it will also give the new Central Asian States trade routes outside the borders of Russia, a perhaps desirable option for states keen to secure their independence.
<P>
• A new line from Iran’s western Azerbaijan to the former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan.
<P>
• A link through rugged terrain from the Persian Gulf port of Bandar Abbas to the inland city of Bafq, which will connect the port with Iran’s railway system.
It opened this year.
<P>
• And an internal link from the southern city of Kerman to Zehedan, which has a rail line into Pakistan.
<P>
Experts say it will take three to five years to complete just one of Iran’s most ambitious and expensive development projects.
But some trade is already using these unfinished routes.
<P>
Iran exported more than $30 million in natural gas, motor way vehicles, textiles and foodstuffs to its Central Asian neighbors in 1993, more than three times the 1992 figures.
Uzbekistan has exported vast amounts of cotton to the outside world via Iran, while Australia has sent exports, such as food processing equipment, to Turkmenistan through Iran.
Kazakhstan hopes to use these routes for its burgeoning mining exports.
<P>
Ultimately, Tehran would also like to use these routes to build other trade and transport systems, most notably for natural gas and oil, via Iran for transhipment elsewhere.
<P>
A second regional focus is reflected in the revived — at Tehran’s initiative — and expanded Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO), sometimes referred to as the Islamic Common Market.
It now groups Iran, Turkey, Pakistan and Afghanistan with Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.
Now headquartered in Tehran, ECO is still in its infancy.
Since 1992, it has negotiated agreements on regional communications and transport, tariffs, free trade and industrial zones, and joint border markets.
Most economies, however, are still locked into old patterns of trade, though some companies are exploring new trade options.
<P>
"It’s a very lively and active regional group that has opened new relations and opportunities for all members," said Rejaie Khorasani, member of parliament and former ambassador to the United Nations, in an interview.
<P>
All ECO’s partners would prefer to both import from and export to Western and developed Asian economies.
With hard currencies scarce and inferior goods to sell, many of ECO’s members may have to look regionally rather than internationally.
<P>
This new regional focus and spirit is underscored in two other organizations.
Iran is part of the new Caspian Sea bloc to deal with trade and environmental issues.
And last year it joined with the Central Asian states, Japan, China, and Russia to discuss reviving the ancient Silk Road, the legendary trade route that once snaked across Asia to Europe.
<P>
Finally, Iran’s regional intentions are reflected in its diplomacy.
Since trade requires peace and security in the neighborhood, Iran, long known in the West as a troublemaker, has increasingly tried to become a peace broker to promote stability rather than upheaval.
<P>
Tehran has been a major player in mediating between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, and jointly sponsored, with Russia, multilateral peace talks in war-ravaged Tajikistan, the most troubled of the former Soviet republics.
"New regional ties are also a security issue for us.
The area is potentially dangerous due to ethnic and border disputes that could spill over into Iran, said the leader of the Iranian foreign ministry’s Institute for Political and International Studies.
"We have common cultural and humanitarian interests, and we are not immune from other’s problems.
Azerbaijan, for example, is only the second Shi’ite government in the world and Tajikistan is the second Farsi-speaking government."
For a country that has spent the past two decades looking with suspicion at a world that it perceived as hostile everywhere, the possibility of congenial neighbors must be enticing.
That Iran is pursuing its good neighbor policy through trade and not propaganda is a prospect that should hearten its neighbors.

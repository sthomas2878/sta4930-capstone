New Moscow-Beijing Ties Worry Asia
<P>
TOKYO: The emerging "strategic partnership" between Russia and China, symbolized by President Jiang Jemin’s visit to Moscow in April, has significant implications for diplomacy and the military balance of power throughout the Asia-Pacific region.
The new "partners" should be watched with vigilance, not because presidents Jiang and Yeltsin have agreed to coordinate their strategies in the region, as many now believe, but because Moscow seems unaware of the negative role it is playing.
<P>
The recent, unexpected improvement in relations between the muddling Eurasian power and the rising Asian power result from a marriage of convenience.
China craves modern arms so as to cope with any possible move for independence by Taiwan; Russia desperately needs to sell its modern aircraft, tanks, and other weapons in order to salvage its defense industry.
In 1995, indeed, China bought over 20% of Russia’s total arms exports worth $2.7 to $ 3 billion, while in 1996 Russian arms sales soared to $3.5 billion, the largest portion of which China purchased.
<P>
Shut out on transfers of military technology and hardware by the United States ever since the Tiennamen Square incident of 1989; feeling increasingly "encircled" by the "redefined" Japan-U.S. Alliance (agreed in April 1996); China is particularly anxious to upgrade and strengthen its military might, and quickly.
Intervention by two American aircraft carriers in the Taiwan Straits in March 1996 humiliated the Chinese, who were forced to stop intimidating Taiwan with missile tests.
<P>
Russia, having seen its gross domestic product fall 40% since communism’s end, needs to retain its defense industry as one of the few sources of national revenues.
Despite initial denials by the Kremlin, China early this year did buy two modern destroyers along with anti-ship missiles from Russia.
An added worry, both for Russia and Asia, is that the Russian government is losing control of the unofficial, black market flow of arms to China.
<P>
Both countries see a convergence -- at least to some extent -- of vital national security interests as the catalyst for their partnership.
Russia and China are both frustrated by the global dominance of the United States since the Cold War’s end, and would prefer to see a multipolar world develop.
Under the current unipolar system they both complain about being deprived of their rightful say on critical world affairs.
China is strongly opposed to American hegemonism, particularly as it effects security in the Pacific.
Agonized by the eastward expansion of NATO, so too is Russia.
<P>
The Jiang-Yeltsin statement of April 3 mentions that "both sides are convinced that [they] ought to be allowed to play an important role in the establishment and maintenance of a new international order."
And President Jiang declared in a speech given at the Russian State Duma that: "the two sides have similar or identical views on a host of major international issues and are stepping up coordination and cooperation in their handling of global and regional affairs."
<P>
Stability throughout Central Asia is a priority of both governments.
Each fears the spread of Islamic nationalism and so each seeks to prevent the Islamic fervor in Iran and Afghanistan from lapping across their borders.
The 1996 and 1997 five-power pacts, which the two countries signed with the three Central Asian countries of Kazahkstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan, which introduced confidence-building measures and reduced troops along the common borders, amount in effect to a regional series of "non-aggression pacts."
Once Central Asia is stabilized and inoculated from Islamic unrest, China and Russia hope to invest their resources in other more important matters, such as the reconstruction of their economies.
<P>
Few Russians may care to admit this, but a strategic partnership between China and Russia means, in effect, a growing Russian dependence upon China, with China increasingly using Russian-made arms to expand its own sphere of influence.
Russia, indeed, is nowadays forced to rely upon China as it attempts to increase its role in the Asia-Pacific region.
It wishes to join the APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) forum, and seeks to do so with the help of the Beijing government.
Perhaps in recognition of this growing diplomatic dependence, Russia pointedly avoids any form of criticism of China’s poor human rights record.
<P>
If Moscow wants to play a larger role in the Pacific area, it must strengthen the economy of its seriously underpopulated Far East region.
This part of Siberia has only eight million Russians, whose per capita income is probably below $2000.
It cannot economically compete with its richer and more populous neighbors, the 45 million South Koreans, the 120 million Japanese, and the over 100 million people in northeast China.
Because South Korea and Japan are reluctant to invest in the Russian Far East, due in large part to deficient infrastructure and public security (as well as to unresolved territorial issues for Japan), Moscow is forced to play its China card again.
<P>
Under present conditions, Moscow will increase its sales of state-of-the-art arms to China, including combat aircraft, long-range bombers, main battle tanks, destroyers, submarines as well as surface-to-air missiles.
It is reported that some Russian factories depend exclusively upon Chinese orders.
With a steady stream of high-quality Russian arms flowing to it, either overtly or covertly, China will increase its naval and air capabilities and strengthen its political position vis-a-vis Taiwan and the disputed Spratly islands in the South China Sea.
In fact China may soon threaten to take over the Senkaku/Diaoyou Islands, which Japan effectively controls today.
China’s ability to project military power at a longer range will, not long from now, enable Beijing to reach the U.S. bases in Okinawa, the strategic linchpin of the Western Pacific.
<P>
Today’s emerging Sino-Russian ties are serving as a catalyst for the rise of opposing camps in the Asia-Pacific region and, perhaps, a new Cold War -- something both Russian and Chinese leaders say they are against.

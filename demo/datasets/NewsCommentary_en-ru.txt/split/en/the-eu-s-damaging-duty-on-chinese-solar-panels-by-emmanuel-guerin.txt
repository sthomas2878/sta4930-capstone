PARIS – The solar industry is in disarray, with companies closing down worldwide and the rate of solar-panel installation slowing.
Now, the European Union, claiming that solar panels from China are being sold below cost, is threatening to impose anti-dumping duties.
But can new trade tariffs really offer a way out of the current situation, in which everyone – Europe, China, the photovoltaic (PV) industry, and the environment – stands to lose?
<P>
In fact, the EU has already imposed a provisional duty of 11.8%, which took effect on June 6.
Unless Chinese and EU officials reach an alternative agreement by August 6, the duty will rise to 47%.
Such a rate would undermine further the proliferation of solar power, a key feature of strategies for enhancing energy security and reducing greenhouse-gas emissions.
<P>
The PV industry’s current predicament stems from a legacy of government subsidies and cheap credit.
Until recently, Europe was encouraging the installation of solar panels by guaranteeing feed-in tariffs for the electricity generated, while China provided strong incentives to stimulate the growth of its PV industry.
<P>
As China’s PV industry grew, production of solar panels surged and prices plummeted.
Given insufficient domestic demand, Chinese companies turned to Europe to absorb their excess capacity, gaining an 80% share of Europe’s PV market at the expense of their once-dominant European counterparts.
This imbalance, together with the eurozone crisis, led EU governments to cut solar subsidies, which in turn caused China’s solar industry to plummet.
<P>
Two strategies for reversing the current decline have been proposed.
The first is to take advantage of the low prices offered by Chinese dumping.
According to this logic, abandoning European production and leaving China to subsidize Europe’s solar expansion would enable the EU to reach its renewable-energy targets at a lower cost, while bolstering the labor-intensive installation business.
With this outcome in mind, nearly 1,000 companies, under the banner of the Alliance for Affordable Solar Energy, have signed a petition against the anti-dumping tariff.
<P>
But, with industrial regions in decline and employment growth lagging, a functioning PV industry is a key condition for making solar-power subsidies in Europe politically tenable.
Moreover, abandoning solar-panel production in Europe would undermine much-needed private research and development – an area where Chinese companies are unlikely to take up the slack.
<P>
The second strategy is equally dubious, for it proposes moving all solar-panel production to Europe.
This would raise costs for consumers to politically unacceptable levels, leading to a sharp contraction in Europe’s efforts to promote solar power.
Beyond the environmental consequences, this would jeopardize jobs in the solar value chain, especially in downstream industries.
<P>
A more promising approach would be to convince Europe to accept a mix of Chinese and European solar panels.
This requires eliminating Chinese dumping if, as Europe claims, Chinese solar subsidies violate World Trade Organization rules.
Ideally, China would abolish the practice on its own, thereby eliminating the need for the EU to erect tariff barriers that, given the highly integrated nature of the PV production chain, would end up undermining European exports of inputs like machinery and silicon.
Indeed, China has already announced that, if its solar-panel exports are taxed, it will retaliate by imposing duties on related imports from Europe.
<P>
In fact, the tax would be inadequate even to achieve its primary – and politically indispensible – objective of paving the way to a healthier trade balance.
After all, China’s ability to produce cheap solar panels is not simply a result of overcapacity; it reflects significant competitive advantages, including low labor costs and easy access to credit.
<P>
Europe must reinvent its industrial policy to encourage the innovation needed to lower the cost of European-manufactured PV panels, and introduce additional subsidies to support the development of cutting-edge solar technologies.
Meanwhile, China should adopt policies aimed at boosting domestic demand for solar power.
This is not just wishful thinking: in less than two years, China’s 2015 target for installed solar capacity was raised from five to 21 gigawatts, and now stands at 35 gigawatts.
<P>
The EU and China should recognize that, when it comes to solar energy, their interests converge.
Developing their respective renewables markets would enable them to reduce their ever-increasing dependence on imported fossil fuels.
Investing in research and development – independently and jointly – would drive the development of innovative technologies, leading to lower prices.
And coordinating their subsidy policies and offering incentives for mutual investment would strengthen the PV sector substantially, benefiting both economies and enhancing the bilateral relationship.
<P>
While the EU’s anti-dumping duty may be a necessary step in persuading China to cooperate, the policy’s short-term risks should not be ignored.
And there should be no illusion that the tariff will be a panacea for an increasingly distressed solar industry.

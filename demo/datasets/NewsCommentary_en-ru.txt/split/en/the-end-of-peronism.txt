The End of Peronism?
<P>
Jorge Luis Borges, Argentina's greatest writer, once said, "Peronists are neither good nor bad, they are merely incorrigible."
As Argentina prepares for its presidential election on April 27 th , the behavior of today's Peronist factions provides conclusive proof of that characterization.
<P>
The Peronist Party has not rallied around a single candidate.
Because Peronist politics is defined by pragmatism and opportunism, not principle, leading Peronists have felt free to pursue their own ambitions as their traditional enemy, the Radical Party, looks set to secure a mere 2-3% of the vote.
<P>
Three Peronist candidates--two former presidents, Carlos Menem and Adolfo Rodríguez Saá, and Néstor Kirchner, governor of the remote southern province of Santa Cruz--are competing for the post.
None is allowed to use either the name or the symbols of the Peronist Party.
But all claim to be Juan Perón's rightful heir.
<P>
What a motley inheritance to claim!
Not even Argentina deserves the history Peronism bequeathed.
<P>
From its first appearance in 1943, Peronism was an unsavory mix of ingredients borrowed from European dictators--anti_Semitism, parades, militarism, all stiffened by a corrupt trade union base.
Juan Perón proclaimed that he chose to serve as Argentina's military attaché in Rome in 1937 so that he could study fascism up close.
Deposed in 1955 and exiled in a string of Latin American dictatorships, Perón finally moved to Spain in 1962, where General Franco named one of Madrid's most important avenues after him.
<P>
In Panama, an astrologer named José López Rega introduced Isabelita, a singer/dancer 30 years Perón's junior, to the old general.
The astrologer's influence with the couple was strong, as Perón attracted a heterogeneous group of acolytes comprising young, well-intentioned leftist enthusiasts, to delinquents and assassins of the far right.
<P>
When Perón returned to power in 1973, he was 78 years old, and his lucidity was failing fast.
Isabelita, by then his third wife, became vice_president.
She assumed the presidency after Perón's death in July 1974, only to fall abjectly under the astrologer's influence.
The Peronist movement soon disintegrated into rival factions, fighting it out in the streets of Buenos Aires.
<P>
Isabelita's corrupt and weak administration was easily deposed by a military coup in March 1976, inaugurating the sordid dictatorship of General Jorge Videla.
More than 30,000 men and women disappeared--killed by the armed forces without even a parody of legality.
Videla's regime saw annual inflation soar to over 350% and real GDP shrink by 11% in 1982.
<P>
To distract people from the economic shambles, another general (Leopoldo Galtieri) ordered the invasion of the British-governed Falkland Islands (in Spanish Islas Malvinas).
Disaster followed.
Defeated and humiliated, the military returned to their barracks, and Raúl Alfonsín of the Radical Party was elected President in December 1983.
<P>
Alfonsín ordered military leaders tried for their crimes.
But he failed to revive the economy in the face of opposition from corrupt Peronist trade_union barons and army officers nostalgic for lost power.
So Carlos Saúl Menem, then an obscure governor of one of Argentina's poorest provinces, followed Alfonsín in 1989.
The Peronist lords regained power, and have misused it ever since.
<P>
The roots of today's Peronist rivalries go back to Menem's term in office.
But the differences between the candidates are not about ideas and programs, but about the power to hand out money, jobs, and patronage to party hacks.
<P>
All three candidates will use any sort of dirty trick to win.
Eduardo Duhalde, who became interim president after first Fernando de la Rúa and then Rodríguez Saá resigned at the height of the economic crisis in late 2001, refused to call for a party primary, because he feared Menem's popularity with the rank and file.
Menem believes that, with the party's official sanction, he can overcome the fact that most Argentines blame him for their current misery.
Indeed, 60% of voters say they will never vote for Menem.
<P>
The second candidate is Adolfo Rodríguez Saá, who proudly announced during his farcical seven-day tenure as provisional president in December 2001 that Argentina would default on its commitments to international creditors.
Duhalde's government openly supports the third candidate, Néstor Kirchner.
<P>
Perón himself would be proud of the absurd demagogy of the three men who would claim his mantle.
Menem promises to raise both private- and public-sector salaries by 30%, while also slashing the budget.
Rodríguez Saá says he will invalidate all 25,000 laws currently on the books--including the nation's civil, commercial, and penal codes--unless they are ratified anew by Congress within 180 days of his taking office.
He would also revoke contracts of electricity, communications, and transportation providers.
Finally, Kirchner promises to continue the Duhalde government's do-nothing policies, hoping to keep his heterogeneous political base intact.
<P>
The disastrous legacy of de la Rúa's government has, meanwhile, severely handicapped the two other serious presidential candidates, Ricardo López Murphy and Elisa Carrió, as both are former Radicals.
Even so, it is a measure of the exceedingly poor choice on offer from the Peronists that support for López Murphy, an honorable, well_educated economist who was Defense Minister under de la Rúa, has climbed steadily since the beginning of the year.
Indeed, pre-election polls put him just behind Menem and Kirchner.
<P>
The tightness of the race makes a second-round run-off vote appear certain.
If that contest, set for May 18 th , is between Menem and Kirchner, then Peronism's factions will, as in the past, quickly reunite afterwards, motivated by their lust for power and the spoils of victory.
But if López Murphy advances to the second round, he could well win, particularly given Menem's negative image.
This might not mean the end of Peronism, but it could allow Argentina to begin addressing the roots of its deep malaise.

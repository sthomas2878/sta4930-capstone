The Integration Conundrum
<P>
CAMBRIDGE – Europe and the United States have rarely mirrored each other as closely as they do now.
Faced with major economic challenges and afflicted by a pervasive sense of decline, they are falling victim to the very principles of global openness and integration that they have promoted for decades.
But, rather than attempting to delay further progress toward interdependence, the US and the European Union are in the early stages of free-trade negotiations – a move that both sides may come to regret.
<P>
Europe and the US have very different relationships with history, reflected in their distinct worldviews.
Europe proudly recalls its contributions to human development, but fears the resurgence of conflict.
By contrast, the US eagerly anticipates its future global impact, with the awareness that its leadership role is transient.
<P>
These perspectives have long shaped both sides’ politics and economies.
Indeed, the EU was founded after World War II in the hopes that the free movement of labor, goods, and services would strengthen social and political ties among conflict-prone peers.
Whenever politics permitted – or necessitated – EU leaders sought to add another brick to the union’s architecture.
<P>
Likewise, the euro stems from an agreement between France and Germany aimed at counterbalancing German unification.
But the eurozone did not meet any of the criteria for an optimal currency area.
The worry now is that the creditor-debtor dispute between northern and southern member states could revive the kind of conflict that European integration was intended to eliminate.
<P>
Similarly, after the Soviet Union’s collapse, the US built an open, liberal international order, imposing its values and interests on the rest of the world before a new superpower could rise to oppose it.
But the system is rapidly turning against its leading proponent, with openness and economic integration benefiting emerging economies in the East far more than their advanced counterparts in the West.
<P>
According to the US National Security Council, by 2030 Asia will surpass the combined strength of the EU and the US in terms of all meaningful indicators of economic, political, and military power.
Like their Western predecessors, these rising global powers are eager to alter the system to advance their interests.
<P>
Yet Europe and the US remain committed to the liberal values that have created their current predicament.
European leaders dream of creating a federal government that would stabilize the eurozone by establishing a banking union and improving fiscal-policy coordination.
Meanwhile, the US is negotiating free-trade agreements with East Asian economies (the Transpacific Trade Partnership) and the EU (the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership).
<P>
But the two powers’ long-term political goals are not aligned with their citizens’ interests.
According to a recent Pew Research Center poll, only 35% of Europeans remain in favor of further EU integration.
And, over the last decade, negative attitudes toward globalization have been gaining traction in both the EU and the US.
<P>
Economic crisis and malaise is undoubtedly fueling fear and uncertainty on both sides of the Atlantic, forcing governments to retrench and limiting their ability to protect their most vulnerable citizens.
But the problem is structural, not cyclical, with a majority of citizens in both the US and the EU lacking the skills and motivation needed to thrive in a fast-changing system that demands constant adaptation.
<P>
Openness is a noble principle, with the potential to stimulate competition, foster innovation, and promote dialogue among countries.
But, when reinforced by rapid technological change, it can be highly disruptive.
In such a dynamic environment, low- or medium-skilled workers can move from shrinking industries to expanding sectors only by continuously enhancing their skills.
Otherwise, the system will marginalize them as their skills’ market value falls relative to those of the most qualified.
<P>
But an inadequate understanding of the nature of these changes, together with an abundance of cheap capital, has led the EU and the US to delay the needed structural reforms.
With blind faith in the market, the US relied on labor mobility to offset the need for economic restructuring, viewing skills improvement as an automatic process.
But this approach has led to rising income inequality and declining social mobility.
Today, millions of jobs go unfilled, owing to skills mismatches (which the imminent 3-D printing revolution will only exacerbate).
<P>
Europe’s approach has been more paternalistic, but similarly destructive.
Regulators protect insiders with strict protocols for firing employees, unproductive public-sector jobs, and generous early-retirement policies.
As a result, youth unemployment and marginalization is mounting, public debt is skyrocketing, and the euro is under threat.
<P>
The EU and the US face a dilemma.
The system that they have created lends itself to ever-increasing openness.
But, given the time and money that retraining the workforce requires, any move toward further integration would further disrupt an already unstable environment.
Only a slowdown of the integration process, at both the European and global levels, can prevent the system from collapsing and enable EU and US leaders to realign their political objectives with their citizens’ needs.

The Unspoken Plans Of The European Union
<P>
LONDON: It now looks likely that the European Union's plan for economic and monetary union (EMU) will start on time, January 1, 1999, with a single currency and participation of a majority of the 15 member states.
<P>
That is certainly what bond markets expect: downward convergence of long-term interest rates, in France and a number of neighboring core countries, toward German levels says that investors believe interest rates in these countries will equalize in ten years' time.
Why?
Because there will be only one currency and one interest rate.
<P>
Bond markets don't have a secret source of information: they reflect the fact that most member governments are making big efforts to assure that EMU happens as promised.
To that end, the governments are making strenuous efforts to cut back their budget deficits, so as to qualify for membership in the single currency.
<P>
At the recent Dublin summit, the EU's 15 governments gave extra credibility to the prospect for EMU, agreeing on detailed rules aimed at ensuring that the fiscal discipline required to join the single currency will continue into the future, past the launch date of EMU.
<P>
Economists question whether EMU is economically necessary, or is likely to work successfully.
Their skepticism turns to astonishment when they contemplate the almost frantic efforts of some of the peripheral EU members to meet the first deadline for monetary union.
<P>
After all, Italy and Spain lack the German tradition of budgetary and monetary austerity.
They may both be committed to the objective of EMU, but they both start a long way back from the austere criteria which would qualify them for monetary union.
Now the Maastricht Treaty (which commenced the processs that will lead to EMU) explicitly allows for the possibility that some member states will meet the criteria before others; so why are the Italians and the Spaniards knocking themselves out in their efforts to join the first wave on January 1, 1999?
<P>
They know that economic and monetary union is not essentially an economic project; it is a political one.
It has an economic rationale as the logical consequence of creating a single market; but the driving force is political.
M. Alain Juppe, France's premier, made the point bluntly: "The European single currency is a political issue, and not a plaything for central bank governors.
It is destined to be the bedrock of the European Union."
<P>
This last sentence explains the desperate frenzy of the Italian and Spanish governments.
They perceive that EMU is intended by France and Germany, and is almost bound to be, the basis of a hard inner core of the European Union.
Masstricht may make allowances for less disciplined countries to lag in joining EMU.
But the fact is that those countries not in EMU will not be part of the political hard core of the EU.
<P>
Why should there be an EU hard core?
Until now, the EU has been unitary; every member committed to common policies.
Why shouldn't this continue?
Two reasons: The first is called Britain, the second is called enlargement to Eastern Europe.
<P>
First, the British reason.
Margaret Thatcher was always an opponent of the ideal of a politically integrated Europe.
British hostility to this objective has become increasingly fierce, as John Major lost his Tory majority in parliament, and fell under the power of the anti-Europeans in his party.
Today the British appear an insuperable obstacle to the attainment by the others of a more integrated EU.
<P>
In law, the British can prevent unwelcome developments in the EU, because the Union is based on a treaty; therefore the British have an effective veto over any change in the treaty.
In practice, the British have already lost this power because they demanded, and got, the right to opt out of participating in EMU.
So if the others make monetary union the basis of a political hard core of the future Europe, the British will not be able to stop them.
<P>
The second reason in enlargement.
Let us be brutally frank.
Most existing members are alarmed at the radical implications of taking in all ten countries of Eastern Europe.
One consequence of a mega-enlargement is that such a vast EU would almost unavoidably have to become a straightforward federation, if it was not to be paralyzed by the sheer weight of numbers.
<P>
We do no know if candidate countries want to join a federal Europe.
Currently, no large member state is prepared to accept that degree of federalism.
So only two alternatives to federation exist.
The first is to block enlargement entirely, or to admit two or three easily digestible countries, such as Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic.
This may be the end result, though no one is saying it aloud.
<P>
The second is a multi-tier EU.
First would come the political hard core, linked to EMU membership.
The second tier would contain EU members not part of EMU and objecting to political integration.
Finally, there would be a tertiary tier, containing new members from Eastern Europe that have not managed to migrate to either of the first two tiers.
<P>
These are two reasons behind the current demand of France, Germany, and the Benelux countries that there should be a "Flexibility Clause" in the treaty, allowing an inner group to move ahead without the others.
What these countries want is a provision that makes it possible to contemplate enlargement to Eastern Europe without facing the consequences of a federation.
This is not what they are saying in public.
But there is an understandable logic to it.
And it explains why the Italians and Spaniards are so desperate to join EMU in the first wave.

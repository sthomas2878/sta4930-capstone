Latin America's Never-Ending Story
<P>
Here we go again.
Latin America is in deep trouble and the usual suspects (the IMF, the US Treasury) have come to the rescue.
The world has seen all of this many times before.
<P>
Thirty years of macroeconomic upheaval in Latin America can be boiled down to a simple lesson: governments throughout the region are too large compared with their ability to raise revenue through normal types of taxation.
Until this vital issue is solved, crises will be the norm, because the fundamental economic choice these countries face will continue to be one between raising revenue through inflation or letting debt grow.
<P>
The typical cycle -- Argentina offers a perfect example -- is one where inflation is allowed to rise for a period.
With this, tax receipts grow while debt remains stable.
But over time, people learn to live with high inflation and insulate the economy from its effects, thus reducing the revenues gained by the "inflation tax."
At this point, government revenues fall, the benefits from high inflation vanish, and political support for stabilization consolidates.
<P>
Stabilization is typically followed by a short honeymoon.
Eventually, however, with inflation lowered and high levels of public spending unchanged, debt starts to grow again.
A new crisis beckons.
The exchange rate is devalued.
Some debts are repudiated and high inflation rates (and the inflation tax) return, both of which help balance the budget.
<P>
Over the 1990s, Argentina tried to tie its hands against such policies by instituting a currency board.
The Argentine currency board is mocked nowadays, but it was a smart idea.
Had Argentina's budget been truly balanced, the currency board would have worked.
Instead, Argentina never balanced its budget, not even the budget net of interest payments on its debt.
<P>
Throughout these macroeconomic cycles poverty fluctuates.
Across South America there is an almost perfect correlation between the revenue gained from the inflation tax and various measures of poverty, because the poor are the least able to protect themselves from the inflation tax.
In Argentina, during the stabilization of the early 1990's, when inflation fell from 1000% per month to zero in a few weeks, the number of poor people was cut in half.
<P>
This explains why the first government of President Carlos Menem enjoyed vast popularity.
It also helps us understand why Menem is now running ahead of other candidates in the polls for next year's presidential elections: along with rising inflation, the number of poor is rising fast too.
<P>
Contrary to what critics of the IMF, such as Joe Stiglitz, say, abandoning the "Washington Consensus" will hurt the poor.
In his recent vitriolic attacks on the IMF Stiglitz implied that he cares for the poor while the IMF does not.
Well, the data contradicts him: using policies that he directly or indirectly advocates -such as using deficits first and inflation later to solve fiscal problems - is especially bad for the poor.
<P>
Raising "normal" tax revenue remains an unrealistic option in most Latin American countries.
What prevents normal taxation is lax tax enforcement, due to corrupt public administrations and a bourgeoisie with a well-developed culture of tax evasion.
Latin America's rich and middle classes are particularly adept at shifting their wealth to tax havens at the slightest sign that tax collection may become tougher.
<P>
Take Brazil.
Brazil has been more successful than Argentina in raising tax revenues.
Since its 1999 stabilization, the budget net of interest payments has constantly shown a surplus, now as high as 3.8% of GDP.
This surplus, however, has not come from reduced spending, but from a set of inefficient and distortionary taxes, mostly on financial transactions.
<P>
The real issue in Brazil today is not whether a 3.8% primary surplus is sufficient to keep the debt stable, but whether the economy can survive its burden of distortionary taxes.
Brazil's government seems to lack the capacity to raise income taxes on the wealthy, which is outrageous given the country's level of inequality.
The election of a populist politician in the coming presidential election will not change this.
No surprise, then, that financial markets are worried.
<P>
Domingo Cavallo, Menem's economic guru, saw through all this, and concluded that the only way out was to reduce the size of government drastically.
If raising income taxes to the standard of industrial economies is impossible, then you must accept a lower level of public services: hence his radical privatization program of the early 1990's, hence his assault on public sector employees and their European-style salaries and benefits.
Argentina's currency board was set up to block recourse to that old easy option, the inflation tax.
It should be no surprise that the country found a way to rid itself of Cavallo and bring back its old populist politicians.
<P>
Latin America does not need financial engineering.
To argue that Latin America's problems are due to IMF mistakes is superficial at best.
The problem of Latin America lies in its high level of government spending, the lack of a solid upper and middle class ready to pay taxes to support it, and the inability to produce politicians able to use tax revenues prudently and so break the cycle of populist demagoguery.
<P>
We plan to store this column carefully.
Sadly, we will be able to use it again, with no change, at the next round of Latin American crises.

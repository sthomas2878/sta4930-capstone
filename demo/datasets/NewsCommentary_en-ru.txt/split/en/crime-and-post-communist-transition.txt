Crime and Post-Communist Transition
<P>
KIEV: Throughout the post-communist world, crime emerges as the greatest public concern, after inflation has been brought under control.
Many believe that the transition to capitalism brings continuously rising crime, leading to a new criminal society.
<P>
It is true that crime rises sharply in connection with the transition to capitalism.
In Russia, Poland, and Hungary, which have the most comparable statistics, crime roughly doubled from 1988 to 1993.
However, in Russia's case two thirds of the rise in crime came before 1992 during the collapse of communism, and crime has stagnated after 1992.
For Poland and Hungary, the first year of capitalism - 1990 - was the year of sharply rising crime, after which crime has fallen slightly.
<P>
The explosion of crime originates both from decaying communism and emerging capitalism.
Remember that communism was often linked with cleptocracy: everybody stole his or her share.
An old joke ran:
<P>
- Which is the richest country in the world?
<P>
- ?
<P>
- The Soviet Union: every body has stolen whatever they can since 1917, and there is still plenty left to steal.
<P>
As communism approached its collapse, people profited ever more from distorted state regulations, such as multiple exchange rates and multiple prices, as the old controls fell apart.
At the same time, new mechanisms of rent-seeking, such as subsidized credits, arose.
Ironically rent-seeking gave the old economic elite the most at the beginning of a gradual transition.
In 1992, subsidized credits, export subsidies, and import subsidies generated gross rents of some $60 billion in Russia.
But liberalization and financial stabilization have put an end to these illicit revenues.
Businessmen can as well become honest and respectable.
<P>
Racketeering is a new form of crime, but it is a reflection of a half-way house.
Entrepreneurs are allowed to set up shops, but they do not feel legal security, because they are harassed by the authorities, with an arbitrary tax system and various licenses in the whole of the CIS.
If entrepreneurs dare to stand up against arbitrary local authorities, they are more likely to stand up against criminals.
This is happening in many large Russian cities, such as Volgograd and Yekaterinburg.
<P>
Initially, the market economy breeds new crimes - especially petty crime such as theft and burglary - because its booty can be resold much easier on a market, and thus becomes more valuable.
Therefore, burglaries, and thefts skyrocket.
However, soon people put up stronger doors with proper locks, rendering burglary much more arduous and less profitable.
Therefore property crimes are falling sharply all over.
<P>
Typical capitalist crimes, such as drug-related crimes, which benefit from open borders, unfortunately continue to rise all over the region and pose serious worries as in the West.
<P>
The most frightening crimes are homicides: in 1994 Russia had 22 homicides per 100,000 people - more than in such murderous countries as Mexico and Brazil, though much less than in Colombia.
The murder rates are similarly high in other former Soviet republics.
In Eastern Europe, the murder rate is about as high as in Western Europe: 2 - 4 per 100,000 people - highest in Hungary and lowest in the Czech Republic.
<P>
Throughout the region, the murder rate has risen with the over-all crime rate and has approximately doubled.
The key to the high murder rates in the former Soviet republics is that the murder rate was as high in the USSR as in the USA - around 9 per 100,000 people.
However, this was a deeply concealed state secret.
<P>
Inhabitants in Russia's big cities argue that it was many times more peaceful before.
Yes, it was - for them.
In the Soviet Union, most dangerous criminals were kept in deportation in Siberia and the Far East, where the murder rate was twice as high as in the country as a whole.
Now, these deported criminals can go to the previously closed big cities and kill rich people instead of poor Siberians.
<P>
But can the corrupt police and law enforcement combat this horrendous criminality?
Yes, many countries in the region, though not all, are already seeing significant declines in their crime rates, and there are many reasons to expect a steady but slow decline in the crime rate for a long time to come.
<P>
The illicit revenues generated from market distortions and fishy subsidies to the rich are abolished with market reforms.
Hence, the state Mafia appears to be losing out to old organized crime, and the degree of symbiosis between the state and organized crime is diminishing.
Where far-reaching privatization has occurred, new owners have a real interest in combating theft.
The new entrepreneurial associations are campaigning for more law and order.
<P>
Legislation is swiftly improved in all the new democracies.
The media are covering crime extensively, teaching people what to watch out for.
People do vote against crime and corruption as we could see in the Ukrainian and Belarussian elections in 1994.
Law enforcement is being strengthened fast in virtually all countries, and the police are getting plenty of new resources for salaries, new cars, electronics and arms.
<P>
During the last years of communism, the prison population shrunk sharply because of amnesties.
Now, the prisons are being refilled.
Capitalism needs lawyers, and they have become very well paid, attracting many able and ambitious students to the legal profession.
In short, there are overwhelming reasons to expect a steady decrease in the crime rate in all democracies in the region with sufficiently far-reaching reforms.
<P>
The situation is reminiscent of Europe after laissez-faire was introduced in Britain in 1846.
For half a century, the public debate was enraged over the supposedly rising crime rate.
In fact, it was the longest period of continuous decline in the crime rate ever recorded, and all legal institutions were strengthened.

The Chinese Market Mystery
<P>
SHANGHAI/NEW YORK – China’s economy is showing strong signs of recovery, with fourth-quarter data indicating a rebound across all sectors.
But, while the country’s burgeoning recovery recently lifted consumer sentiment to a five-month high, the country’s stock-market performance has remained weak.
<P>
Indeed, in late November – after a year of accommodative measures and mini-stimulus policies – the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) Composite Index closed below 2,000, for the first time since January 2009.
Less than a month later, Chinese shares rose by 4.3%, bolstered by the index’s largest single-day gain since October 2009, a reflection of rising confidence inspired by strong manufacturing data.
But, when the World Bank raised its forecast for Chinese economic growth in 2013 to 8.4%, the index closed flat, at 2,162.
<P>
The SSE ended 2012 with a 3.17% up-tick, and it is currently close to 2,280.
But, if China’s economy is rebounding, why is its equities market responding slowly – and at times negatively – to strong signs of recovery?
<P>
Last November, the SSE still ranked only seventh worldwide in terms of capitalization, at $2.2 trillion – far behind the stock exchanges of New York, London, and Tokyo.
The market value of the New York Stock Exchange’s Euronext is more than six times higher than that of the SSE.
Even Tokyo’s market is valued at 1.6 times Shanghai’s.
<P>
In fact, the SSE’s current market capitalization resembles that of Canada’s stock exchanges.
But Canada has a population of 35 million and an average GDP growth rate of 0.8% over the last half-century.
By contrast, China has a population of 1.3 billion, and has experienced three decades of 10% annual GDP growth.
<P>
More important, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange’s market is valued at more than $2.6 trillion, roughly a half-trillion dollars more than the SEE.
Despite its population of only 7.1 million, Hong Kong remains the international access point for aspiring Chinese multinational enterprises.
In November alone, the Hong Kong exchange’s market value rose by 24.3%, while Shanghai’s declined by 9.5%.
<P>
This situation is unsustainable.
If Shanghai is to become China’s international financial center by 2020, as China’s State Council announced in 2009, the renminbi must become fully convertible, and the SSE must begin to reflect China’s economic performance more accurately.
<P>
To be sure, the SSE’s history has been volatile.
It originated from the First Treaty of Nanking, which in 1842 ended the First Opium War and formed the foreign concession areas in Shanghai.
In the 1860’s, the market for securities trading began in Shanghai, leading to its emergence as the financial hub of the Far East by the 1930’s.
But, when Japan invaded the international settlement in 1941, operations were abruptly halted.
Four decades later, Deng Xiaoping’s program of economic reforms facilitated the development of China’s securities market.
As a result, in 1990, the SSE resumed operations.
<P>
The first discrepancy between China’s economic and market performance appeared in 2001, when China joined the World Trade Organization.
High expectations caused the SSE to peak that year, but the economic expansion that followed – in which soaring exports fueled rapid GDP growth and increased prosperity – was accompanied by a four-year slump in equities prices that halved the market’s value.
<P>
To stop the slide, the government banned new initial public offerings in 2005, allowing more than $200 billion of mainly state-owned equity to be converted to tradable markets.
This constraint caused demand for equity participation to soar; so, when the ban was lifted a year later, speculative traders rushed into the market.
But, after reaching a peak of more than 6,100 points in October 2007, the global economic crisis erupted, causing the index to fall by an unprecedented 65% by the end of 2008.
<P>
In an increasingly multipolar world, the rise of large emerging economies is changing the logic of markets.
Wall Street, which today is ruled by sophisticated and experienced institutional investors with long-term vision, evolved from the bottom up.
But Shanghai’s emerging exchange, which remains dominated by inexperienced individual investors with short-term perspectives, is expanding from the top down – leaving it particularly vulnerable to global volatility.
<P>
Moreover, given its colonial history – the so-called “century of humiliation” – China remains wary of a significant foreign presence, which partly explains why foreign portfolio investment amounts to only 1% of total market value.
And regulatory approvals for IPOs can take years – and often enter the marketplace with little regard for investor demand.
<P>
But change is afoot.
Last spring, the authorities cautiously initiated a set of financial reforms aimed at expanding the country’s equity, bond, and currency markets.
The stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen are making it easier for small firms to sell bonds via private placement.
Similarly, the privatization of state-owned enterprises is an important barometer for progress on structural reforms.
<P>
Meanwhile, regulators are taking steps to address investor concerns, by, for example, lowering trading fees, strengthening the requirements for dividend payments by listed companies, and tightening delisting rules and restrictions on companies suspected of insider trading.
But investor protection also requires appropriate supervision and sanction mechanisms.
<P>
More recently, the country’s foreign-exchange regulator removed the $1 billion limit for foreign sovereign-wealth funds, central banks, and monetary authorities purchasing Chinese assets through the qualified foreign institutional investor scheme (QFII).
And some expect China to relax or abolish a rule that requires renminbi-denominated QFII, or RQFII, funds to be invested mainly in bonds.
<P>
But China’s financial markets still have a long way to go.
Further reform is needed in commercial banking, lending markets, bond markets, securitization of loan portfolios, competitive entry, and other areas.
Rather than continuing to export capital to other countries, the Chinese people should become the primary beneficiaries of their own savings.
This requires a financial system capable of processing those savings.
<P>
In the coming years, China’s new leaders hope to prioritize consumption over investment and exports, while extending economic progress beyond coastal regions.
If these measures are supported by gradual financial reform, Chinese stock markets could finally fulfill their potential.

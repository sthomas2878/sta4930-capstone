Argentina Helps Lead The Way In Privatizing Social
<P>
CHICAGO: Since 1989, Argentina has rapidly introduced revolutionary reforms that greatly reduced government regulations and controls.
Privatization of its social security system is the most important step during the past couple of years -- I recently went there after a three year absence to speak to a conference on this program.
Argentina's experience demonstrates that even under very difficult economic circumstances, a nation can successfully convert from a pay-as-you-go social security (PAYG) system to a competitive private pension plan with individual retirement accounts.
<P>
PAYG taxes workers to pay benefits to currently retired persons.
The combined social security tax on employees and employers in Argentina had reached 50 percent of wages, a crushing burden.
This tax helped discourage companies from hiring additional workers.
Private employment has been stagnating and the unemployment rate ballooned to more than 17 percent during the serious depression the past two years induced by the Mexican crisis.
<P>
To avoid the high social security taxes and onerous labor market regulations, many workers and companies operate in the illegal underground economy.
Argentinean economists estimate that almost half of all workers have either illegal or informal jobs, a staggering percentage.
<P>
Since so many workers do not pay social security taxes, the dependency ratio, the number of retired persons per each worker who actually pays social security taxes, has been only a little below one, among highest ratios in the world.
This created a vicious circle since high social security taxes in the legal economy shifted workers into the black economy.
This forced still higher taxes in the legal economy to finance retirement benefits, which encouraged further shifts into the black economy, and so on.
<P>
The privatization program started in 1994 gives each worker the option of either remaining in the old system, or placing their additional old age contributions--prescribed at no less than 111 percent of their wages -- into one of many private pension companies.
Growth of the private system has accelerated after a slow start, so that over 60 percent of the workers have already chosen a private fund.
Before long more than 90 percent of workers will be saving for retirement under a private plan.
<P>
Workers with their own accounts accumulate retirement assets as they add to their contributions, and as they earn interest and dividends on the fund's investments.
The funds have mainly invested in government bonds, but they will allocate more of their assets toward private equities and bonds as the Argentine economy recovers from its depression.
Their investments in private stocks and bonds will expand the Argentinean capital market, which is underdeveloped compared to some of the Latin American countries.
High rates of return on these retirement funds should also greatly raise Argentina's savings rate once its economy fully recovers.
<P>
All employer social security contributions are still used to finance benefits to retired persons.
But notwithstanding the need both to pay current retirement benefits and to build up new accounts for workers, the combined employer and employee social security levy has been cut by some 10 percentage points .
The higher yield on private pension investments means that workers with private accounts can contribute less than under the old system and still expect larger retirement benefits.
Moreover, employee social security payments are no longer a tax but an investment in retirement income, so that some workers are leaving the black economy for the legal sector.
This adds to employer contributions to the PAYG system.
<P>
Economists tend to worry about the transition from a PAYG system to private social security.
But Argentina is showing, as Chile has successfully demonstrated for 15 years, that the transition can be managed rather easily, despite the apparent "double taxation," because a private system is so much more efficient than PAYG.
<P>
Still, naysayers continue to claim it is not advisable for the United State and Europe to privatize their social security systems, and to try to frighten retirees into believing that benefits will be reduced.
In fact, the transition should be far easier in America and Europe than in Argentina since they have much more developed capital markets, and tax rates needed to continue benefits to retirees would not have to be so large, given the much lower dependency ratios in these nations.
Moreover, their transitions will become more difficult the longer they wait since the number of older retirees is continuing to grow much more rapidly than the number of workers.
<P>
Many Central and Eastern European nations are now deciding what type of retirement systems to introduce for their workers.
A few officials from these countries were present at the Argentinean conference where I spoke.
These nations can avoid the political and economic difficulties encountered by Western Europe and much of the rest of the world by choosing privatized social security instead of pay-as-you-go systems.
Singapore, Hong Kong, and other Asian countries that introduced retirement systems in recent years have learned from the bad experiences of Western nations and have been avoiding pay-as-you-go systems.
<P>
The economically advanced countries should feel humbled by the fact that two emerging nations have pioneered privatizing social security.
I believe that both retired persons and workers in these countries, and those in Eastern and Central Europe, would welcome privatization if they know how successful the transformation has been in Argentina, a nation with more difficult economic problems than even the most stagnant European economy.

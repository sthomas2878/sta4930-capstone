The Democratization of Diplomacy

HAMBURG: How does citizen protest and government action relate in modern democracies?
Those seeking an answer may find it in the recent international outcry over the new series of French nuclear weapons tests in the South Pacific.
<P>
Last June, shortly after the successful international agreement on the indefinite extension of the Treaty banning the proliferation of nuclear weapons, the newly elected French president Jaques Chirac announced that France would conduct a final series of tests on Muroroa Atoll.
France was not the only nuclear weapons state to announce new tests; China, too, made clear it would proceed with its current programme.
Yet it was on France that international anger homed in.
While most governments, with the exception of those in the region, were embarrassed but remained silent, protest groups were angry and loud, taking to the streets and, around Muroroa itself, even to the waters.
<P>
These protests will flare up again and again until the series will end in early 1996.
They have been unable to stop the French programme.
Yet they nevertheless have had a remarkable success.
Not only did France commit herself to a watertight international ban on all nuclear explosions, to be agreed by international treaty at the end of 1996.
The French government also stated that in the future France's nuclear forces would no longer have an exclusively national function but could be used for the protection of her partners in the European Union as well.
While those hints have not yet gone beyond generalities, they nevertheless expose a need which France in the past has rarely revealed, the need for partners, even in the nuclear field.
<P>
Would France have made these moves in the absence of international protest?
Probably not.
The government in Paris, which should have known better, was taken utterly by surprise by the intensity of international hostility to its nuclear objectives, and, as governments do in such situations, has tried to limit the damage.
<P>
It is not long ago that French experts had argued that the treaty banning nuclear explosions, which the nuclear weapons states have committed themselves to sign by the end of 1996, would have to allow small scale nuclear tests if only to reassure French nuclear bombs against the problem of nuclear ageing', the uncertainty whether all parts of the atomic bomb remain reliable.
<P>
Yet under the impact of the world-wide anger, Paris overrode the experts.
On August 10, the French delegate to the Geneva Disarmament Conference, where the treaty is being negotiated, declared that his government will demand a ban of "all nuclear weapons tests and all other types of nuclear explosions".
One day later, President Clinton endorsed the French undertaking.
<P>
Similarly, on all aspects of European defense integration within the European Union, France had long been the most ardent advocate of the sanctity of national sovereignty; her recent rapprochement to NATO was possible only because the Western Alliance, with the collapse of its old rival, has become a more traditional military pact anyway, less shaped by American leadership and more open to intergovernmental bargaining.
Yet under the impact of anti-nuclear and anti-French demonstrations, Paris practically pleaded with its major EU partners, particularly Germany, to consider some kind of co-responsibility for the force de frappe.
<P>
So the success of non-governmental protest against the French test series has been remarkable, sending a signal not only to Paris but also to the other capitals of nuclear weapons states that the days of non-controversiality over their nuclear status are gone.
Yet it revealed, at the same time, the limited effect of international protests directed against legitimate governments: the protests aimed at stopping the tests; however, if they were successful, it would have endanger the very progress it has produced.
<P>
If France and China were forced by angry public opinion to stop their current tests, there will be no water-tight test-ban treaty next year.
For both, their nuclear programme is a matter of national security, they will forego future testing only if they are confident they can maintain their nuclear forces without such tests.
If France and China were prevented from completing their series, they would either refuse to sign a test-ban treaty altogether or insist on such major exceptions that the treaty would be devalued, to the delight of the test lobby in the United States and elsewhere and the frustrations of all those who want to stop the bomb from spreading.
<P>
Australia's Prime Minister Paul Keating recently spoke for many demonstrators and regional governments when he stated that the French nuclear test series at Mururoa Atoll "causes anger throughout the world not only because of concern for the Pacific environment but because it puts at risk our hopes for a post-Cold War world that does not have the nuclear shadow hanging over it".
Yet the best hope for escaping from the nuclear shadow lies not in stopping the small number of French and Chinese tests.
It lies in making sure that they are the last ones.
<P>
Since the beginning of the nuclear age, a total of 2037 nuclear tests were conducted; 1030 by the US, 715 by the then Soviet Union, 45 by Britain; China has exploded 43, France 204 nuclear devices.
China plans to add another three, France another six or seven.
However understandable the international outcry these additional nuclear explosions are an inescapable price for the big deal - the comprehensive test-ban treaty.
<P>
Similarly, if France were to give in to international anger and cancel all further tests, the nascent disposition to Europeanize the French deterrent would be nibbed in the bud.
Instead of opening its nuclear efforts to some serious European participation, the humiliation of having to cave in to international protest would lead France away from any European solution and back into the refuge of national sovereignty.
Paris would blame not its own lack of political foresight for the defeat but the lack of support from its European partners.
European integration across the board, not only in the defense field, would suffer a major setback as Paris licks its wounds.
If the price for France's continued willingness to act as a major promoter of European integration is a handful of nuclear tests, it is a price worth paying.
<P>
For those organizing the protests against the current French test series, it is difficult, even impossible, to admit the basic truth that their short-term aim contradicts what must be their long-term objective: a world in which there are fewer nuclear weapon states and in which national sovereignty is curtailed.
Yet if they succeeded in stopping France from further testing, their victory would be a failure certainly in terms of preventing nuclear proliferation and possibly in terms of enhancing European integration.
<P>
It was not least thanks to the effort of the protest movements that France has now made concessions on both these counts.
But how can these concessions, given under duress, be secured?
That is a task for which non-governmental organizations and protest movements are not well equipped: they can raise public conscience, but they cannot formally commit governments.
Only other governments can do that.
<P>
Hence the effort to nail down the concessions that the protests have extracted, the hour of governments has arrived.
They must now nail down France on a watertight testban and lobby for a similar commitment from China; and France' s partners in the European Union must now challenge the government in Paris to spell out what it means by "Europeanizing" the French nuclear strategic forces, if it is serious at all.
<P>
This does not mean that the protesters should roll in their banners and go home.
But they should realize that if they had been successful in what they set out to do, theirs would have been a Phyrric victory.
What they have done is to launch the flanking shot which governments now have to place in the French goal.
That is no mean achievement, provided governments in Europe and elsewhere take up the challenge and cease to hide behind the protesters.
Otherwise what has been gained through protest could easily be lost again once the demonstrators have dispersed after the last explosion at Muroroa Atoll in early 1996.

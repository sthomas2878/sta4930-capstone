Russia After And Between Elections
<P>
MOSCOW: Communism has made a comeback and yet calm prevails in Russia, that is the curious result of the elections a fortnight ago.
<P>
The predicted shift of the Parliament to the left - not of tectonic, but still of tangible proportions - has happened.
It looks like that the communists together with their possible fellow-travelers will control close to half of the Duma seats.
This is short of a constitutional majority, but still a powerful instrument to influence policy.
But the Russian Constitution requires a two thirds of Duma votes to pass a constitutional amendment.
And without change of the constitutional balance of powers, the Duma remains relatively impotent vis-a-vis the president.
<P>
This is the main reason why the governing establishment and the markets reacted to the election results with equanimity.
Another reason is that V. Zhirinovsky proved to be a paper tiger, while the communists now appear to be not so bad after all.
Here the return of communists to power in Eastern Europe, where they have not reversed reforms (though they have slowed them) may be providing false assurance.
And the nationalist party led by general A. Lebed -- another bogeyman with which members of the Russian liberal intelligentsia were alternatively threatening each other or falling in love -- did not make it to parliament.
The general was elected, but in a single constituency district, perhaps demonstrating that his ability to pull in votes is not all he cracks it up to be.
Much of his appeal (at least so far), may be lost, which goes some way toward explaining General Lebed's decision that he would prefer to run as the communist's candidate for president.
<P>
One more reason for their equanimity is the fact that Russians are simply tired of being afraid of politics.
Instead of warring or worrying -- occupations that drained time and energy -- most are more interested in making money, investing, building dachas, caring for their families -- all the needs of daily life.
<P>
However, this calmness, being in principle a helpful sign, may be premature.
The voice of protest could rise to the surface once again, and with far more dangerous results.
<P>
Moscow's elite, inhabiting a boom town informed by a press geared to elite tastes, might miscalculate the mood of the country.
Indeed, in Moscow and St. Petersburg voting results were the polar opposite of most areas of the country.
<P>
The Moscow elite - economic and political - supported by a large but not overwhelming layer of regional elites, which benefited mightily from "stakhanov" style shock privatization, wants stability and fears most of all a fight over a renewed redistribution of property.
Russia, it must be noted, has undergone one of the greatest property redistributions in human history over the last five years.
More of Russia's economy is in the private sector than in most of East and Central Europe, as well as a number of West European states.
<P>
For the groups which benefited from market reforms and privatization, Boris Yeltsin and Viktor Chernomyrdin remain the favorite candidates for next June's presidential race.
President Yeltsin is all the more popular for having proved himself to be the best guarantor of the continuation of reform.
<P>
But Yeltsin has lost most of his general popularity and prime minister, Chernomyrdin, remains a clumsy public politician, in spite of obvious improvements in his performance lately.
Another relatively liberal politician -- the outspoken economist G.Yavlinsky -- lost the support of most of the elite because of his often maverick pronouncements.
Next June he could carry some of the popular vote (mostly from elements of the intelligentsia), but the question is whether he could withstand a candidate embodying the protest vote without massive financial backing from Russia's new "moneyed" elite, backing which now looks unlikely to come his way.
<P>
Another powerful impediment to the victory of an establishment candidate is the weakness of party machines and the almost religious belief in the powers of the media to deliver votes.
Despite being president for more than half a decade, Yeltsin does not have yet a coherent voting machine except for his administration, which has not proved to be too effective, particularly at generating grassroots support.
V. Chernomyrdin's machine did well on TV, but failed in the provinces.
G. Yavlinsky, who has been proposing himself as a candidate for the presidency for three years, barely managed to create a viable party or a campaigning mechanism for the recent Duma elections.
<P>
So some members of the presidential court and many establishment groups are already beginning to campaign to postpone the presidential elections.
Some of their arguments are powerful.
They say that democracy is not merely the vote; that without a secure private property regime, democracy is nullity.
As a leftist president with a leftist parliament would certainly undermine the road to capitalism and democracy; the longer Russia stayed on this road without detours, the less chance there would be for a semi-return to totalitarian power.
Therefore, the most democratic thing for Russia might be to postpone a vote.
After all, Yeltsin should not allow himself to become a new Hindenburg.
<P>
But if elections are postponed, nobody will know when or if the vote will return.
Without a legitimate president -- and by cancelling the elections, Yeltsin would certainly risk forfeiting claims to legitimacy -- any successor (a prospect that must be weighed, given the president's suspect health) would be even less legitimate.
Indeed, without a democratic safety valve, a social crisis could possibly erupt.
<P>
So the Russian establishment must first find a viable candidate that unites the myriad groups that support reform.
Simultaneously, it must find a way to share power in the six months leading up to the elections so as to divide the opposition, diluting its force.
To achieve both goals, Russia's elite will need to share some of its new wealth, and not only with people hurt by reforms, but with the state, through enacting taxation schemes that allow, say, for energy taxes to begin to cover some of the costs of pensions.
<P>
Today, these tasks look huge.
But Russia has beaten greater odds over the past five years.
Almost nobody believed that Russia would go so far, so fast, in its democratic and capitalist development.
If Russia passes this last hurdle it would -- though periodic crisis and difficulties will, of course, continue -- finally be on the road to success.

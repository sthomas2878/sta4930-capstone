The Heart of Reconstruction
<P>
CAPETOWN – As theeighteenth-century theological philosopher Emanuel Swedenborg reminds us, thewritten word is humankind’s exclusive property.
So there is a commonly acceptedrecognition that the responsibility writers possess for this treasure is great.Yet there are as many disagreements about the role that literature is to playin society as there are definitions of that role.
<P>
Some see writing aspurely the aesthetic exploration of language, of the word.
Indeed, some modernauthors, as Susan Sontag once remarked, can be “recognized by their efforts todisestablish themselves,” that is, by their “will not to be morally useful to thecommunity.”
Such writers do not seek the role of social critic, but rather envisionthemselves as acting as “seers, spiritual adventurers, and social pariahs.”
<P>
The German novelistThomas Mann was deeply opposed to such deliberate isolation on the part ofwriters, posing instead the claims that society makes upon art: “the courage torecognize and express – that is the quality that makes literature.”
And asimilar argument can be heard from the Polish poet Czeslaw Milosz: “What ispoetry which does not save nations or peoples?
A connivance with officiallies.”
<P>
In the recent history ofour country, we South African writers have been faced directly in our poetry,prose, and plays with the daunting challenge of which Milosz spoke.Transformation of the world of apartheid by literary means and or style wassimply not a possibility in a world of racial classification, mass relocation,and removal of peoples; the silencing of our people by detention without trial;the banishment of our people to our own Devil’s Island; and the overwhelming andever-present racist rhetoric of Verwoerd, Botha, and Terreblanche.
<P>
If literature was tomeet the challenge posed by apartheid at all, it had to act in light of whatthe critic Walter Benjamin most admired in the playwright Bertolt Brecht: Theaim and responsibility of the writer must be to cause his or her audience to beastonished at the circumstances under which he or she is functioning.
<P>
From that unambiguouspremise came what is known as our protest literature.
And if the aestheticexploration of the word was no longer the goal, it could not be abandoned entirelyand with disdain; whatever we wrote and now write, with whatever purpose,whether to express the struggle for freedom or the passion of a love affair,can approach the power of truth only to the extent that we are capable ofexploring the splendor of language brought into its service.
<P>
In South Africa, we hadto clear our language of apartheid’s claptrap and the official euphemisms thatsought to shroud the horrors of our daily lives – euphemisms such asresettlement” for “banishment,” and “permanent removal” for “death-squadassassination.”
Yes, we had to clear our heads of the official language beforewe could write in a creative one; and some of us had to pay dearly for writingsthat asserted the truth in the face of connivance with the official lies: Ourbooks were banned from publication and removed from circulation, and weexperienced – either formally or through pressure on our family, friends, andassociates – personal bans that kept us from the outside world (and the outsideworld from us).
Worst of all, some of us were condemned to bans that silencedus, bans that prevented us from writing at all.
<P>
Today, we South Africanwriters are hungry for an exchange of ideas with writers and artists from whomwe were forcibly quarantined for so long.
This creative isolation was somethingthat we accepted as part of our contribution to the global political, economic,and cultural isolation of the apartheid regime, an essential strategy in thestruggle for liberation.
Now we are free to enjoy and profit from our growingcontacts with literary comrades (a word that may have poisonous associations inthe former communist countries, but that continues to be used here for its connotationof genuine human solidarity) from our own continent and with whomever willinvite us to their countries or, even better, come to ours.
<P>
On our home ground,black and white South Africans are now legally brothers and sisters, unitedformally and politically in one country.
But how can this formal status be madeinto a social and spiritual reality?
Art and literature were at the heart ofthe revolution, and they must remain engaged today, for they lie at the heartof reconciliation and reconstruction as well.

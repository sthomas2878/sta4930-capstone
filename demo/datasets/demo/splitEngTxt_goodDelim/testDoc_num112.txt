In addition to infrastructure development, landscaping work is being performed in the region: workers are planting trees.
There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 are large enough to host international-level competitions.
Many Chinese regions with resort locations, including Zhangjiakou, experience problems with snow.
The main long-term goal is to provide a comfortable and interesting stay at Chinese resorts so that all newcomers become regular visitors.
However, this is still far away.
Game-planning consultant Justin Downes says that, since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese ski industry has changed beyond recognition.
Every year, more and more Chinese go to the slopes in winter.
One of them is Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing.
Downes believes that, despite some substantial changes, it will take many more years to establish a ski culture here.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.

This statement was made by U.S. President Joe Biden.
"There never were such plans," said the head of the White House in answer to a journalist's question about whether the USA had rejected such an idea.
Biden noted that if the situation around Ukraine escalates, Russia will face economic consequences.
At the same time, he emphasized that the USA and NATO have no obligations to use military force to protect Ukraine in case of escalation.
The American leader also said that the possibility of using American troops unilaterally to defend Ukraine was not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invades the territory of Ukraine, the USA will deploy their forces to Eastern European NATO countries (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Czech Republic and Estonia).
"We will have to send more American and NATO troops to the eastern flank, B9 â€” all those NATO countries for which we have a sacred commitment to protect from any Russian attack," stated Biden.
Earlier, Dmitry Peskov, press secretary to the Russian President, emphasized that Moscow had no intentions to invade Ukraine.
At the same time, he pointed out that Moscow saw a problem in Kyiv's military use of drones supplied by Turkey, as well as in the fact that "American weapons are getting closer to our territory".
I walk out of such interviews immediately.

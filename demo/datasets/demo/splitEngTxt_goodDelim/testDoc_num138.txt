The problem with women is that they slowly-slowly take everything on themselves.
Vadim Denisenko, a former member of the Verkhovna Rada, listed four possible scenarios for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in 2022.
According to him, the state's leader could lose support from the West and possibly agree to make compromises over Donbas.
Denisenko shared his opinion in a publication on the Glavred portal on Sunday, December 12.
The first possibility, dubbed "the perfect storm" by Denisenko, is Ukraine losing support from key Western countries that would come to an agreement regarding the country's future without its involvement.
Such a turn of events would contribute to a serious crisis that Kyiv could face in 2023.
According to Denisenko, there is also another scenario — "war against everyone."
This prediction will come true in the event of highly turbulent world politics causing a number of problems for the Ukrainian government.
This situation might force Ukraine's leadership to compromise on Donbas, which could lead to a conflict within the country.
In late summer, Zelenskyy's standing will weaken; according to the ex-deputy, this situation has a 50–55% chance of occurring.

The Government of Dubai has announced a complete phase-out of paperwork and a transition to digital technologies.
All government services to the population will also be provided only in electronic form.
This is reported by the Emirates News Agency WAM.
"This day marked the beginning of a new digitalization stage for all aspects of Dubai's life â€” we have completed the transition to a completely paperless government," said Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of the Emirate, Chairman of the Executive Council of Dubai, on Saturday.
Now internal and external document flow will be carried out only in digital form through special information platforms in all the government institutions of Dubai.
The transition to electronic government and digitalization of document flow in Dubai started in 2018.
During that time, the authorities estimated that 336 million sheets of paper were saved, which is 14 million man-hours and 353.8 million dollars in monetary terms.
Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said earlier that electronic services save citizens 2 days a year.

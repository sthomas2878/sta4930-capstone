In Pushkin Street, the OMON officers took and took in a tough way.
They asked in a typical way about the motives.
When they heard, they basically looked with understanding, if not with appreciation.
Except for the police lockup being breezy on all 4 sides, everything was as proper as possible, but I knew what I was signing up for.
And if after the act at least several people start writing their poetry under this hashtag, I won't sit through these 10 days in vain.
Maxim, according to the protocol, in private, you may speak even in the language of the tumba-yumba tribe.
But at public and official events they speak the language of the people around, so that everyone can understand what happened in the Bundestag on September 25, 2001, or in their native tongue through an interpreter.
This is nothing more than a protocol, by the way, Angela Merkel speaks Russian fluently but still turns to an interpreter for help.
Also, at official events, transcription is done in the old-fashioned way with a fountain pen, and the transcriber does not need to know several languages.
Or else so much water.

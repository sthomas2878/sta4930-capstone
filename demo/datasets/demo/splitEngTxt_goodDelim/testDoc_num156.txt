It is better now.
Progress is being made, but sluggishly.
The problem is this: there are many environmental initiatives in the cities, but people do not know about them.
All kinds of eco-taxis that take waste away from home.
At least a recycling site â€” it is used by social outcasts.
It is rare for anyone to bring glass or metal there.
Right now I would happily stuff my face with the Soviet sweets with white filling.
They are no more.

Healthcare professionals listed early signs of Alzheimer's disease.
Problems with vision may be considered as the first warning sign due to which the patient develops difficulty in recognizing objects.
Specialists listed another sign of developing dementia â€” aphasia, or a condition where a person fails to find the right words to express what he wants to say.
Former Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili needs psychoneurological treatment and rehabilitation abroad, neurologist Otar Toidze, who is a member of the physicians' council established under the ombudsman of Georgia, told reporters.
His [Saakashvili's] neurological status is leading to his illness.
Stable problems are problems with movement, coordination, mood changes," said the specialist, noting that this is not beyond standard limits and the ex-president should now be sent for special rehabilitation.
"We call it neurorehabilitation and psychoneurological rehabilitation, the possibility of which we have not found in Georgia," said Toidze, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution that does not exist in Georgia.
On the evening of December 7, Saakashvili started sabotaging the receipt of medical care after he was disciplined by corrections officers.
The Georgian politician quickly managed to quash his sentence and restore his former rights.
Here is another side of the medal.

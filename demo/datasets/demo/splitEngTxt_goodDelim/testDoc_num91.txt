Commenting on the main features of the ANKA vehicles, Arestovych said that it is about jet, not piston UAVs.
According to him, this is the next generation of drones after Bayraktar, which are better than the last "in all specifics".
Arestovych concluded that the plant should produce the first batch of UAVs by the end of next year.
The ANKA aerial vehicle was created by the Turkish Space Agency in February 2014.
Turkey's authorities had been developing it in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
A day earlier, the Ukrainian General Staff classified data on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems during the joint forces' military operations in Donbas.
On December 6, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that the country had begun the construction of a plant to build modern unmanned military aerial vehicles.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On September 29, Bayraktar Savunma and Ukraine's Ministry of Defense signed an agreement to build a center in Kyiv Oblast where they would train personnel and test and maintain Turkish Bayraktar UAVs.
The Ukrainian leader's press office called this memorandum "a real big step forward."

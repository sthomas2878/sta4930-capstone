The BioNTech and Pfizer study showed that the effectiveness is significantly lower with two doses of the vaccine: "the neutralizing potential is reduced by more than 25 times."
"It indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the omicron strain," emphasized BioNTech and Pfizer.
Therefore, a third dose is necessary.
Experts insist on accelerating rate of the vaccination in the country.
For example, Bernd Salzberger, chairman of the German Society for Infectious Diseases, advocates shortening the interval between the second and third vaccination.
Moreover, according to Salzberger, the accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both the delta virus and the omicron variant of coronavirus.
"Israel's experience shows it very convincingly," emphasized the expert.

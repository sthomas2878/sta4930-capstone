Consumers should be aware that hidden sugar may be indicated by an unfamiliar word in the product's composition — an ingredient similar to sugar in calories, composition and glycemic index.
The label may indicate several dozen names, which in fact mean sugar.
Some of the most common and widespread names are glucose and fructose.
According to Roskachestvo, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to eat whole and unprocessed food, and also to pay attention to the label and the many different names for sugar.
Different types of sugar vary in taste, but no matter the name of the ingredient in product contents — syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white — it is still sugar.
Therefore, the total amount of sugar may be significantly higher than indicated on the label.
Germany's new chancellor Olaf Scholz said that gas imports are losing importance for Germany as the country continues its transition to decarbonization of the economy.
According to him, Germany plans to completely abandon gas, oil and coal by 2045, becoming a climate-neutral country.
"So that in 25 years the world will be such that the issue of gas transportation to Germany and Europe will play a different role," said the chancellor.
Sholz noted that Germany remains committed to Ukraine transporting Russian natural gas in the future, as at the moment this resource is essential for the energy transition.

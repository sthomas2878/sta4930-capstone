This happened to me.
A woman came to see the apartment.
I came from another town to show it.
The advertisement had detailed photos and a description of the apartment.
She was extremely unhappy because there wasn't a "lavish" kitchen and "lavish" balcony.
The woman clearly has nothing better to do, she looks at other people's apartments, while people waste their time.

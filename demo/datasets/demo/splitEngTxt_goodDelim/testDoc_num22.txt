Over 60 poems were written throughout the year, many of them are real masterpieces; the cycle "Persian Motives" was completed, the poem "Anna Snegina" was written, 8 books were published, "Soviet Russia" collection.
And the main success â€” in late June in the 25th year, Gosizdat entered into an agreement with Yesenin to publish his works in 3 volumes.
Money was needed that year as never before.
Yesenin married Leo Tolstoy's granddaughter Sophia Tolstaya, it was needed to set up the family home, support the sisters Katya and Sasha, as well as the mother.
How sick I am.
Nor do I know whence came this sickness.
Alcohol strips my brain.
Many acquaintances noted that Yesenin had a significant breakdown, looks bad, is clearly ill.
Drinking bouts and nervous breakdowns happen more often.
However, if somebody gave Sergei Aleksandrovich such a diagnosis as alcoholism, there are no original documents left.

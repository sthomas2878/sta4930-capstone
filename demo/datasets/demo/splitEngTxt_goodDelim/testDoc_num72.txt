Just as before, iOS users spent more than Android device users: iOS accounted for 65% of all in-app spending.
The most downloaded app of 2021 was the video editor CapCut.
It was followed by two Indian apps: the video service MX TakaTak and the online shopping app Meesho.
Telegram is also in the Top 10 in terms of downloads.
In general, judging by the number of downloads, users tend to favor VPN services (there are two of those in the Top 10 — VPN Master and NightOwl VPN) and services for creating and streaming videos (in addition to CapCut and MX TakaTak, the Top 10 includes two more services of this type — Moj and SnackVideo).
"Users spent the most money on video sharing and online streaming apps," the report's authors say.
YouTube is the leader here; the Top 5 for user spending also includes the video service TikTok, the streaming video services Disney+ and HBO Max, and the Japanese manga subscription service Piccoma.
The top spots in terms of monthly active users are held by Telegram, Instagram, Zoom and TikTok, with Microsoft Office's mobile version closing the Top 5.
In Russia, the year's leader in terms of downloads is the shopping app AliExpress.
It is followed by the Zenly service that detects your friends' locations, and once again CapCut.

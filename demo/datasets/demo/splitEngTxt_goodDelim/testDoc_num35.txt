Earlier today, Elizabeth Truss, the head of British diplomacy, claimed that Russia will face "serious consequences" in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
According to her statement, this meeting has shown the "united voice of the G7 countries, that account for 50% of the worldâ€™s GDP and send a very clear message that the invasion of Ukraine would have massive consequences for Russia".
The effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the omicron strain of coronavirus is 32 times lower compared to other types of the disease.
This conclusion was reached by scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, reports South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was found to be less effective based on a study of the antiviral activity of citizens who received two doses of the drug against COVID-19.
"We see that most people had a high level of antiviral activity against the original Sars-CoV-2 variant, but this ability was significantly reduced against the omicron variant," said Professor Malik Peiris.
At the same time, scientists emphasized that vaccination remains the most reliable way of protecting against the severe illness when infected with coronavirus.

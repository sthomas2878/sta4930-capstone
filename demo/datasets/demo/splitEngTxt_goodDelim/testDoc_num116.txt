The map shown by Ms. Tang was prepared by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked the countries by their degree of safeguarding civil rights.
On the map, Taiwan was highlighted in green as "free", while China, North Korea, Laos and Vietnam were in red as "closed".
When the Minister showed the map, the picture was replaced with a screenshot noting that the opinions of the discussion participants "do not necessarily reflect the position of the US government."
China was not invited to the Summit for Democracy.
Reuters sources note that the map demonstrated by Taiwan's Minister might have been contrary to the "One China" policy that Washington adheres to.
An agency source stated that after the map was shown, the United States National Security Council contacted the Department of State accusing it of showing Taiwan as a separate country.
The Summit for Democracy organized by Washington was held on December 9â€“10 and was attended by representatives of 110 countries and territories, as well as civil groups and charitable organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During "Day Zero" of the Summit, Nobel Peace Prize winner and Novaya Gazeta Chief Editor Dmitry Muratov called on the establishment of an international fund through which corrupt money would be given to charity.
Earlier today, the Deputy Secretary of the Russian Security Council Yuri Averyanov stated that the summit had an "anti-Russia and anti-China attitude."

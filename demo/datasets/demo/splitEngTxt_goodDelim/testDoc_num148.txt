According to market participants, the shortage of products at the moment can only be replaced by imports.
But some of them, such as Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix, managed to survive thanks to, among other things, regular domain renaming, he adds.
For example, Lostfilm, which is found in both Yandex and Google search results, has pirated copies of the Netflix TV series "Squid Game" and "Nezhnost", an original TV series from the biggest Russian video service Ivi (Part of the AIV), by movie director Anna Melikyan.
Kinogo, also found by the search engines, offers the new cartoon "Encanto", but in terms of quality, this is a so-called camrip (a pirated movie copy filmed in the cinema).

A plumber who found money in a church wall in the U.S. state of Texas will be paid a reward.
This is reported in a press release from the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident took place at the large Lakewood evangelical church where pastor Joel Osteen preaches, promising wealth and prosperity for devout Christians.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Cauley was repairing one of the church's toilets and found thousands of bags with money and checks under the insulation.
He handed the find over to the church and, according to him, did not even receive thanks from Osteen.
"I wanted to hear him say: 'You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you did and what you could have done,'" KPRC-TV quotes him saying.
Apparently, the find is connected with a theft that happened at the Lakewood church seven years ago.
About 200 thousand dollars in cash and 400 thousand dollars in checks, which were kept in the church safe, were stolen then.
The money was insured, so the church did not suffer any losses.

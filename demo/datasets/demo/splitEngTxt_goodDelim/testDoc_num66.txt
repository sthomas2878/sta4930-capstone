Our communal apartment from Bolshaya Zelenina in Petersburg, more precisely Leningrad, still keeps in touch.
Of course, we're not the closest friends, but we try to keep up the warm relations of the older generation.
Maybe it's because there were no strangers in the apartment, rooms weren't let out, and there was always the siege brotherhood.
Unfortunately, we see each other more often at funerals.

Comfortable layers of the mattress — combination of a coconut slab and artificial latex with relief surface — ErgoFoam.

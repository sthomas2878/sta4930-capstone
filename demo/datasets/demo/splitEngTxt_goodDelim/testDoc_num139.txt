The third possible scenario for Ukrainian politics is a conflict between those groups of people who disagree with Zelenskyy and the president, which may result in the seizure of control over the security wing, and the implementation of "populist initiatives."
Under this crisis scenario, Zelenskyy will start "reformatting power," added Denisenko.
Yet another scenario is Zelenskyy's transformation into the "father of the nation."
This could be caused by an event that will deliver a severe shock to society.
"The event must be large enough to elicit a reaction from international partners and encourage increased support for Ukraine," added Denisenko.
The ex-deputy believes that this scenario could materialize as a result of a natural or man-made disaster, or Russia's aggressive actions.
Russia itself has more than once dismissed any possibility of "attacking" Ukraine.
Moscow says it is the Ukrainian government, NATO and the U.S. who are increasing the level of military activity near Russia's borders.
Earlier, on November 11, survey data from the sociological group Rating showed that the Ukrainian president's popularity hit an all-time low of 19.3%.
This is the lowest it has been since his election as the head of state.

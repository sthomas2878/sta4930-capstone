The model is convenient because it has two surfaces of different softness â€” very firm and slightly above average.
The product's composition includes only high-quality and premium fillers that have proven themselves exclusively in the best way.
Springs: a micropackage independent pocket spring unit is placed in the center of the model.
This means that there are 2,000 absolutely autonomous springs per sleeping area.
Their functioning is what provides the unique point adjustment.
Micropackage is the highest frequency of all Dimax pocket spring units, so it has a pronounced orthopedic effect and is considered premium.
Fillers: combinations of coir and natural latex layers are placed on the top and bottom of the springs.
The only difference is the order of the slabs.
If one surface has latex, then the other has coconut coir.
Such a tandem of fillers has long borne a classic status, because it gives the mattress not only orthopedic but also anatomic properties.

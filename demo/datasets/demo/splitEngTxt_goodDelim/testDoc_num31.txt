Lamoda Fashion Expert Ilya Vakhoshkin warns that when it comes to a velvet jacket, the main thing is not its model or design but its appropriateness.
Another important criterion, which when is met allows to choose a velvet jacket, is the status of its buyer.
They are simply invited to coinciding social events, where the dress code is always specified.
Ilya Vakhoshkin suggests combining a velvet jacket with things that are just as elegant: classic pleated pants, solid-colored shirts, silk ties, tassel loafers, cufflinks.
Things that are too simple and casual will look inappropriate.
Fashion experts from Krasavchik Brammell are convinced: the appearance of an ordinary employee in a velvet jacket at a corporate party will be inappropriate, but if it is "one of the heads from those who run the event, then â€” yes, such a thing will be just for him."
If an employee is lower in rank, and his goal is to move up higher in the company's complex hierarchy or wheedle out financial bonuses, than it would be better not to put on a velvet jacket.
Management will definitely appreciate it with the phrase "the hat is not for Senka", according to the editors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion.
Very ambiguous feelings about the voice.
The tone is unnatural, it sounds so forced.

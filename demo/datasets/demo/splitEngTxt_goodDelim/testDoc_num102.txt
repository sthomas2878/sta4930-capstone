The USA and Russia will "bargain" on Ukraine joining NATO, according to the article of analyst Alexander Kochetkov for Glavred.
In his opinion, in the very near future Washington and Moscow are going to continue negotiations on the guarantees of the United States regarding Ukraine not joining the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the statement by the American leader Joe Biden that any country is entitled to "join any alliance."
If you receive a deliberately unacceptable offer, well, for example, to sell your relative into sexual slavery, you would not bargain, but just tell them to go to hell.
However, they are going to bargain about Ukraine," the analyst wrote.
Kochetkov added that Russia is not going to invade Ukraine, but rather strives for dialogue with Kyiv.
"Preparations are discreet, fast and immediately turn into an aggressive strategy; you do not wait for the troops to be discovered and counter-force to be deployed," he noted.

The WHO reported on the strain's spread rate.
According to the organization, as of December 9, the strain has already been detected in 63 countries, in all six WHO regions.
This is despite the fact that it has only been actively spreading since the end of November.
The WHO is also concerned about the high spread rate of the new coronavirus variant.
WHO experts fear that, according to preliminary data, the new strain can beat the Delta strain spread rate, the same as the Indian coronavirus variant, which is now leading in all countries without exception.
Previously, the director-general of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that the omicron strain could have a significant impact on the course of the coronavirus pandemic.
Similar conclusions were also reached in the UK.
Experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that Omicron will displace Delta in the coming months.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths caused by the Omicron strain, and more than 2 thousand people will be hospitalized every day at its peak.
The British healthcare system will not be able to handle this.

Lions escaped at Singapore Changi Airport.
This is reported by The Straits Times.
Two predators managed to get out of a container with seven lions that arrived on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore and where they were headed.
One of the escaped lions lay down on the roof of the container.
The animals could not get away from it because of the nearby protective net.
The confrontation ended when employees from Mandai Wildlife Group, which manages all the zoos in Singapore, arrived at the airport.
They immobilized the lions with tranquilizer darts and plan to deliver them to a quarantine institution.
It was reported earlier that in Phnom Pehn, the capital of Cambodia, a lion escaped from its owner and walked the city's streets.
The animal voluntarily returned home the same day, people were not hurt.

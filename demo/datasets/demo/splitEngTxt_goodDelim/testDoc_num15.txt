As the immune system did not respond, it spread extremely fast.
"It seems to have more spike proteins than it should, and its antibodies remained at the same level during mutation," comments pulmonary specialist Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor suggested that people with a weakened immune system may have a milder form of Omicron than people with strong defensive mechanisms in the body.
It turns out that a strong immune response to anything, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
It happens in the case of pneumococcal disease, when young 30-year-old people die and 60-year-old people recover like from a common cold.
"Young people have a strong immune response, it's crazy: where it could just have shaken its finger, it takes a musket to kill a butterfly," concluded Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor also recalled that the coronavirus has dangerous adverse effects, the most unpleasant of which is pneumonia.
Pulmonary inflammation can be bacterial and viral.
While the first type can be treated quickly and successfully, in the second case, you can only reverse symptoms â€” all hopes rest with the body.

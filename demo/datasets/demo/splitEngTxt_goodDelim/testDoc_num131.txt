On one side of the mattress, there is a 3 cm high layer of coconut coir giving the mattress additional firmness and durability.
On the opposite side of the mattress, there is a 3 cm layer of coconut coir and a 1 cm layer of natural latex.
Natural latex has anatomical effects and wear-resistant properties.
The mattress cover is made from cotton Jacquard quilted with eco-friendly Hollcon material.
The fabric is treated with a special antibacterial agent, Sanitized (Sweden).
The treatment ensures complete destruction of mold fungi, and prevents the development of microorganisms, dust mites and bacteria.
The mattress comes with four convenient handles for turning it over, and aerators for the additional ventilation of the mattress layers.
Along its perimeter, the mattress is reinforced with an artificial latex frame, which significantly prolongs its life.
But the "best finisher" at 1.5 km and after 50 km are two different things.
I was, well, I was not even a driver really.

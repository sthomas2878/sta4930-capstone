The outer case for this mattress is made from dense Jacquard with synthetic fiber.
The material is strong and durable, does not wear and does not require complex maintenance.
Earlier this week, Alexander Volchenkov, a 21-year-old poet, was arrested for ten days.
The HSE student was detained in Red Square with a banner, which had the #apoetinrussiaismorethanapoet hashtag written on it.
This is a quote from the writer Yevgeny Yevtushenko.
A report was drawn up for Alexander on the grounds of repeatedly violating the rules of public protests, which is an administrative offense.
The first time he was detained on January 23 in Pushkin Square during a rally in support of Alexey Navalny.
"The goal was to draw attention to poetry as a whole â€” now, regrettably, it has lost its appeal; to highlight the overall decline of culture in Russia; there was also a bit of hope to inspire unknown poets to post their poetry online with this hashtag," explains Alexander.
We contacted the young poet to find out the circumstances of the detention and study his message in more detail.
This time the employees were more tactful, the detention was as polite as possible, however funny this sounds in a certain context of this word.

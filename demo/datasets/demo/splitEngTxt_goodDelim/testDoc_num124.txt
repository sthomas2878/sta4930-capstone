Dimax OK Basis Mattress, size 130x185.
The OK Basis spring orthopedic mattress is one of the most affordable models in this product line.
Its Balance Foam practical filler provides the mattress with all necessary orthopedic properties, while keeping the price affordable.
This product offers the optimal trade-off between price and quality.
Balance Foam is a modern material made from PU foam.
The filler is hypoallergenic and safe.
This is why it is widely used across the industry.
Its safety and reliability are confirmed by a special certificate received in Europe, where such requirements are much stricter than in Russia.
Another important feature of Balance Foam is its orthopedic function: the material keeps the person in the right position throughout the entire sleeping time.
Thanks to this foam, the firmness of the mattress became less than medium, which is why the manufacturer considers this product to be rather soft.

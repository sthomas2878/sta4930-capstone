The Beautyson Sense Hard S600 mini Sint mattress is compact, comfortably elastic and firm, wear resistant and durable.
The Beautyson brand product from the Sense series is designed to provide healthy sleep for people suffering from joint and heart conditions.
The design provides even load distribution across the surface with a tangible sense of comfort.
The Beautyson Sense Hard S600 mini Sint mattress is based on the S600 mini pocket spring unit with springs of decreased height.
For their fillers, Beautyson uses spunbond, coconut coir and polyurethane.
The spunbond serves as the intermediate isolation layer between the soft materials and the springs.
The orthopedic charcoal-infused foam is shape-cut on the surface to achieve a micro-massaging effect.
Coconut coir is a hypoallergenic material that gives the mattress good moisture exchange and air permeability characteristics.

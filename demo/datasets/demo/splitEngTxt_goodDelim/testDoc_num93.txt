Studies show that an excess of vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
The Daily Express warned about this.
According to specialists, there is strong evidence that people who are not deficient in folic acid are less likely to get certain types of cancer, particularly colorectal.
However, on the contrary, exceeding the required dose promotes the growth of cancer cells.
Nutritionist Ben Kitchin, Professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, advises monitoring the amount of folic acid you consume throughout the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The threat of cancer increases only if you significantly deviate from this number upward or downward.
Kitchin recommends not taking vitamin B9 in pills without a doctor's recommendation, be sure to monitor the dosage and avoid flakes with milk or other food that contains folic acid.
Previously, nutrition consultant Rachel Fine called folic acid a substance that slows down aging.
As it, among other things, is contained in avocados, Fine recommended that men over 50 eat this fruit more often.

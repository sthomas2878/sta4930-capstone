Earlier, scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of the coronavirus pandemic, taking into account the impact of the omicron strain on it.
The study's authors concluded that the Omicron strain could trigger a new wave of virus circulation and an increase in mortality if no additional measures were taken.
Oleksii Reznikov, head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, has accused the government of the former German Chancellor Angela Merkel of preventing Kyiv from buying deadly weapons from NATO.
In his interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov recalled that last month Germany vetoed Ukraine's purchase of counter-sniper systems and rifles for striking drones.
There is also a mention that Berlin later softened its stance on the rifles, acknowledging them as non-deadly weapons.
According to the Minister of Defense, Kyiv intends to make every effort to obtain the above-mentioned weapons as part of the bilateral agreements with its allies.
In particular, this refers to the United States, the United Kingdom, Lithuania and France.
However, as FT points out, the position of the new German government headed by Chancellor Olaf Scholz on permitting weapons supplies to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, the Ukrainian Ambassador to Germany Andriy Melnyk expressed the opinion that Kyiv should not expect deliveries of weapons from Berlin under Chancellor Scholz.
According to him, the previous German leadership attributed its refusal to supply weapons to the risk of military escalation of the Donbas conflict, despite the fact that "Russia was occupying" part of Ukraine's territory.

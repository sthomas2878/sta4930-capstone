Prepare your clothing for long storage in advance by cleaning it and straightening creases.
Pick a suitably sized bag: the clothes shall not fold from the bottom.
It is not recommended to put several bulky pieces of clothing in one bag: they might get crumpled.
If you value all things neat and tidy, cherish your clothing, and wish to preserve it for as long as possible â€” go ahead and order a garment bag.
Velvet jackets prevailed at the social events of 2021.
Perhaps, the first person to declare his new fashion decision was Daniel Craig.
Back in September, at the premiere of "No Time to Die", he appeared in a velvet crimson jacket and a traditional Bond bow tie.
His example was then followed twice by Prince William, who first put on a green velvet jacket that was inappropriate for the royal dress code at The Earthshot Prize environmental award ceremony and then chose a more classic version for an event in support of the Royal Variety Charity.
Lionel Messi also tried out the trend a few weeks ago.
The footballer came to pick up his seventh Golden Ball in a velvet Dolce & Gabbana jacket.

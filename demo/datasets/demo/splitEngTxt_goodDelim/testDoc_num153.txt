Until now, it was believed that the clouds of Venus, which is the planet closest to Earth, were too acidic to sustain life, but Venus was probably an Earth-like planet originally.
A sample should be brought from Venus during the third mission.
Assuming we discover life there, the main question will be whether it is similar to that on Earth or if it is in fact different.
If it is very similar, it will be obvious that terrestrial life did not originate on Earth.
If, however, it differs, it will be more likely that life originated on Earth," said Mihkel Pajusalu, the head of the Estonian Venus Life Finder team.
The topic of the metaverses gained popularity in fall this year, when Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook was rebranded as Meta.
This event was an important signal for the market: the biggest player confirmed that a new format of digital communication between people was underway.
It means that business in Russia, like in the rest of the world, will invest in its own metaverses and their further monetization.
Metaverses are worth viewing as the continuation of existing real-world trends.
On one hand, this results from the trend of distant interaction during the pandemic, because people are tired of separation and restrictions.

I remember supporting her at the Seoul Olympics, for us, the inhabitants of Primorsky Krai, it was live, in real time.
So much passion, the emotions were running high, I remember the joy when Elena won.

I once watched a documentary movie on TV about a Central American country, and there they rolled watermelons along the gangway on to the ship, like barrels.

I buy watermelons that weigh 4â€“5 kg right from the melon field and no earlier than the beginning of August.

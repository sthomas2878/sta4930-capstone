The yacht features a "moon pool" and a submarine to explore the sea depths.
But it has a symbolic value considering that there are just over 2,000 multibillionaires in the world.
It is just another example of hyper-consumption by quite a small group of people.
Scientists discovered that the emission footprint left by billionaires is several thousand times bigger than the footprint left by an average inhabitant of the planet.
While a single person produces 5 tonnes of CO2 per year on average, the major contaminator of the planet, Roman Abramovich, is responsible for 33.9 tonnes of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere in 2018.
By the way, two-thirds of the emission footprint was produced by his 162.5-meter-long yacht Eclipse.
Even when the owner is not on board the yacht, the crew continues to poison the planet.
The owner may call the captain and order them to bring the yacht from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean Sea, for example.
Superyacht owners get no sympathy from other people when they complain on YouTube, like Gina Rinehart, Australia's richest woman Australia who owns mines on the continent, that there is no space to moor their giant vessels.
Also, it is difficult to understand her pleas to build marinas for more than 50-meter vessels.

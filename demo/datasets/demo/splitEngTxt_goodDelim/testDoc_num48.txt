Experts also recommend having a separate card for online purchases.
If money was stolen when shopping in stores that do not use the protective 3D Secure technology, you can initiate the refund procedure.
"Within the rules established by payment systems, for unauthorized transactions made without the use of 3D Secure, the responsibility lies on the participant in the payment chain who does not use this service," said the representative from Promsvyazbank.
Artur Zaremba, an expert at the international payment provider Ecommpay, emphasized that the buyer is entitled to apply to the bank to dispute a fraudulent transaction no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the criminal used the card on online resources that do not require two-factor authorization, the transaction can be protested and the money returned.
It is noted that in some cases, online stores return funds to the customer themselves if the order has not yet been sent for delivery.
On November 19, Ekaterina Mizulina, member of the Public Chamber, head of the Safe Internet League, reported that 11 thousand appeals on different cases of fraud were received in 2021 alone: from the sale of forged documents to the theft of personal data.
According to her, an effective solution in the current circumstances may be the creation of a single window for complaints against online fraudsters.
The newly elected German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw for talks on the migrant crisis on the Belarussian border, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, Russia's troop buildup around Ukraine and the Russian Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline situation.
Although Scholz declared his aspiration for good long-term relations between Germany and Poland, the leaders of the two countries expressed unambiguous expectations from each other.

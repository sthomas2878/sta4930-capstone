These vibs have a higher specific weight than their close-in-size analogues, which certainly has a positive effect on the application nuances of these interesting baits.
Another recognizable feature is the upper finlet made of strong and resilient plastic, which creates additional degrees of vibration during vertical and horizontal retrieval.
Bet-A-Vib demonstrates quite an aggressive game as a "winter vib" in plumb fishing.
A simple monotonous animation is often the best for fishing, which means moving the rod up and down almost without any pauses.
When planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient when fishing in a limited space, cluttered with submerged aquatic vegetation, snags and other obstacles you can get caught on.
In addition, a slight deviation is relevant when fishing for zander or large perch in winter, and especially in the middle of winter, when you need a point and aggressive bait feeding.
Upon reaching the extreme point of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly turns around and returns to the initial vertical.
Also, Bet-A-Vib is equally successful when used during winter fishing for pond trout.
To please it, you can choose from two modifications: with a noise capsule (NS — NanoSound) or without it (SL — Silent).
It is also noted that the Bet-A-Vib play plumb can annoy a passive pike that does not react even to live bait.

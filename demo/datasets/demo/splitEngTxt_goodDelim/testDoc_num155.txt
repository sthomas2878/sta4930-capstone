British economist Jim O'Neill could not give any forecasts for 2022, as, in his opinion, such attempts will prove to be a complete failure.
He wrote an article about it for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that next year will be full of uncertainties, and any trend may change the situation.
He suggests that the coronavirus pandemic remains the key factor, and the second one is inflation.
O'Neill also admitted that he does not know whether the price increase is temporary.
As the specialist noted, before the pandemic it was clear that "the world of the infinite generosity of central banks is a spent force," and now is the time to get back to the relations where interest rates considering inflation will correlate with the expected GDP growth rate.
O'Neill noted that in view of the pandemic, sticking to a very soft economic policy, according to some experts, may lead to new burst of inflation.
Moreover, it is worth focusing on the issues of productivity growth, increase in the level of poverty, and climate change, O'Neill summarized.
Mikhail Shulgin, Head of Global Research Department "Otkritie Investitsii", reported that positive expectations from the USD exchange rate for 2022 still remain, however, growth potential will be less significant.
Among risks for the USD exchange rate, Shulgin listed the FTS monetary policy, oil price variations and concerns regarding the coronavirus pandemic.

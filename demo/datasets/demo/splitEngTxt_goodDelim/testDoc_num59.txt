The world's first human infection with the H5N6 virus strain was recorded in May 2014 in the southwestern Sichuan Province.
Since then, the number of such cases in the country has reached 53.
In Brazil, Luis Roberto Barroso, judge of the Supreme Federal Court of Brazil (STF), delivered a judgement obliging people entering the country to show their covid passports.
This is reported by CNN Brazil.
People with counterindications for vaccination would not need to present a vaccination certificate.
People arriving from countries where the absence of vaccines is proven are also included in the list of exceptions.
"The situation is even more serious considering that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for holding New Yearâ€™s, pre-carnival and carnival parties, and other events, which implies an increase in the tourist flow," noted Barroso.
Earlier, the Brazil government obliged tourists who are not vaccinated against Covid to follow the five-day isolation period.
According to him, it can be achieved by injection and by using a nasal vaccine.
Immunoglobulins A protect the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot enter the body.

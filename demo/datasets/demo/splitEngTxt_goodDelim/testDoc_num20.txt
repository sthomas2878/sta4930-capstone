The Turkic language family is the only thing they have in common.
Credit Suisse demands that its employees provide access to their personal mobile devices, according to the Financial Times.
The issue is that the Swiss bank does not provide corporate communication devices to its employees in Europe and the USA, and offers a discount to buy a mobile phone or a smartphone from its partner telecom operator instead.
According to the applicable rules, the bank is able to view information on corporate devices provided to its employees, as these are used to contact colleagues and clients for business issues.
The bank takes advantage of its right to check mobile devices in emergencies, for example, if an employee uses the device to have a meeting with a client that has not been approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, when most employees have switched to remote work, the bank wants to expand the scope of this rule to cover all devices used for business purposes.
According to the newspaper, the bank's management established a deadline for employees to familiarize themselves with the new rules.

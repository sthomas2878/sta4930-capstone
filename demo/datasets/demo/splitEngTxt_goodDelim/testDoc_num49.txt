Poland's Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said that he would call on Scholz to act against Nord Stream 2, which is designed to transport Russian gas to Germany bypassing Ukraine.
According to Morawiecki, Russia can use the gas pipeline as a means of political pressure against Europe.
In turn, Germany supported Poland's effort to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin announced its assistance to Warsaw and Brussels in resolving this crisis.
Poland's judicial system, however, remains one of the reasons for disagreement.
The European court fined Poland, having established that the judicial reforms adopted by the right-wing Law and Justice party infringe EU law.
Poland refused to pay the fine and its supreme court has ruled that national laws have priority over EU rules.
The new German government, sworn in on Wednesday, despite the demands of Poland and the US, has not made any public commitment to halt Nord Stream 2 if Russia invades Ukraine.
American officials declared to members of Congress that they had reached an understanding with Germany about halting the gas pipeline if Russia invaded Ukraine, reports a high-ranking US member of Congress on Tuesday.
German officials did not confirm these statements, but on Wednesday, Scholz warned of the consequences of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and this position was confirmed by G7 on Sunday.

Father is taking care of his young daughter.
And he loves, as Lermontov wrote, "with a strange love".
Why didn't he tell his daughter that it is not a school.
Well, she'll have a tail.
Will retake.
Millions of students know this.
The Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Poland Pavel Yablonsky expressed the opinion that the President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko used the refugees as a "weapon" against the European Union and intends to repeat such an "operation" next year.
The Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs made the corresponding statement in his interview with the Australian Financial Review.
According to Yablonsky, sanctions against Belarus "stopped Lukashenko" for a while; however, he is "actively searching for new ways."
The Polish minister is also certain that illegal migrants will now be used as a weapon "throughout the world."

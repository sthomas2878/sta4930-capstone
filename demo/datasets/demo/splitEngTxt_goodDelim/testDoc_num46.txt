"Russia should have no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have large-scale consequences and a serious cost," it says in the statement published on the United Kingdom government's website.
The G7 ministers and the EU High Representative said that they were "united in our condemnation of Russia's military build-up and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine."
At the press conference in Liverpool, the British Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss warned that Russia will face "major consequences" if it invades Ukraine.
The G7 wants Russia to renounce its aggression against Ukraine," she said (as quoted by TASS).
Earlier, at the Liverpool summit, the G7 foreign ministers agreed that in order to resolve the crisis caused by Russia's military build-up on the Ukrainian border, the parties must return to negotiations.
This referred to negotiations in the "Normandy format".
The North Atlantic Alliance also spoke in favor of the "Normandy format" dialog on Ukraine.
Maria Zakharova, representing Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said that, by urging Russia and Ukraine to return to negotiations, the G7 countries "admitted their inability to take responsibility for their own mistakes."

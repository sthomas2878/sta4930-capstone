The Indian Prime Minister's account had been hacked before back in 2020, with calls for donations to a fund in cryptocurrency.
The third referendum in New Caledonia that took place on December 12 ended with the same result as the previous two.
According to the first partial result declared at noon on Sunday, December 12, the majority of the population of New Caledonia voted against their territory's independence at the referendum.
At the same time, participation rates during the third voting were much lower than in two previous ones.
According to early results published by the local government, 3.51% (2,755 people) of voters voted for independence, while 96.49% (75,762) voted against it.
As France-Presse agency commented on these early results, the "outcome of the voting left no room for doubt", because independence supporters called on electors not to participate in voting.
While being the initiators of the referendum, they came out against holding it on December 12, considering that the new epidemic COVID-19 outbreak on the archipelago would hinder the implementation of a full and "honest" election campaign.
Therefore, this non-participation led to the third victory of the French New Caledonia supporters, after the referendums that took place in November 2018 and October 2020.
56.7% of citizens voted against independence in 2018 and 53.3% in 2020.
Separatists stated that they reject the results of the last voting and will appeal against it to the UN.

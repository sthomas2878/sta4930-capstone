As reported at the Elysee Palace on Sunday, December 12, Emmanuel Macron, the President of France, should speak about the results of this referendum.
The topic of New Caledonia's independence significantly revived the last weeks of France's presidential campaign.
Several presidential candidates stated that the territory should remain part of France because it is "the last region of the European Unionâ€™s presence in the Pacific."
"New Caledonia should certainly remain French," Eric Zemmour repeated several times.
Valerie Pecresse, the Republican candidate, also supported this claim by publishing a column in Le Figaro at the end of October, where she urged Caledonians to remain French.
For his part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he will not take a stance "because it is not his responsibility."
At the same time, the President added: "France would not be as beautiful without New Caledonia".
In return, Prime Minister Jean Castex announced the "strong aspiration that the choice of Caledonians would become the choice of France".

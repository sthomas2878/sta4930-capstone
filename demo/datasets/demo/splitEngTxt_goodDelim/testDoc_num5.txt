"We expect that a fourth vaccination will be required in the summer, in the fall at the latest," the expert believes.
In addition, Weigeldt hopes that the fourth coronavirus vaccination can be carried out "in combination with the flu vaccination".
This will help to achieve the best results.
In addition, the increased vaccination can help fight the spread of the Omicron new coronavirus strain.
Moreover, the new variant is especially dangerous.
Thus, reinfection with Omicron is three times more likely than with the Delta or Beta strains.
Evidence of this comes from the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
On this basis, the manufacturers BioNTech/Pfizer plan to provide a vaccine adapted for Omicron by March 2022.
The companies emphasize that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new variant of coronavirus Omicron.

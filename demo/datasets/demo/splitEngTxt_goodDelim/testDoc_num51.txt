MinTsifry, which will establish the fund, informed the Parlamentskaya Gazeta that it will be used for writers' residences.
MinTsifry is preparing a draft Presidential Decree on establishing the fund to support Russian writers.
The explanatory note clarifies that the fund will be entrusted with taking care, among other things, of the intended use and preservation of buildings and structures that formerly belonged to the Soviet Union of Writers and the Literary Fund.
"The Russian Federation has inherited a significant amount of real estate that used to belong to the Literary Fund of the USSR, including those located in Peredelkino writers' village in Komarovo village Leningrad Oblast, and others," the MinTsifry Press Office told the Parlamentskaya Gazeta.
According to the draft decree, the Fund's articles should state that the Fund "is being established for the purpose of facilitating literary activities by creating the necessary conditions for the creative work of writers."
As MinTsifry explained to our publication, "'creating conditions for creative work' means the creation of residences for writers that would have comfortable conditions for creative work, based at transferred real estate in different regions of Russia."

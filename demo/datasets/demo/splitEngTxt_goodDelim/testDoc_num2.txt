Promtex Micropacket Prestige Mattress 105Ñ…195.
The Micropacket Prestige model: comfort and natural composition.
The two sides of the mattress have different firmness: the medium firm surface is made from coconut fiber and natural latex, and the moderately soft one is from a natural latex slab.
The spring unit with 1,000 springs per square meter quickly adapts to the sleeper's body, preventing the "wave" or "hammock" effect.
Another advantage of this model is its breathable materials.
The latex perforated for air permeability is naturally well-ventilated, as is the coconut coir.
This ensures a healthy micro-climate for the sleeping area.
There is also an extended warranty for this mattress.
The official warranty from the manufacturer is valid for 5 years, but the mattress will actually last longer.
Protection from dust and dirt is delegated to the removable Jacquard cover that comes with the package.

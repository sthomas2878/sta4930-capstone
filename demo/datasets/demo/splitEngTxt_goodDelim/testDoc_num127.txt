According to Ryabkov, the problems are related to the desire of the USA to enforce its approaches on Russia on a variety of issues.
The Deputy Foreign Minister added that he would not risk giving optimistic predictions about the prospects for improving relations and would not expect Washington's position to change.
He explained that with the exception of such areas as strategic stability and cybersecurity, there has been no progress.
At the same time, Russia calls on the United States to take a responsible approach to international security issues and hopes that the signals will be heard and Americans will listen to the arguments of common sense.
Earlier, at a meeting with the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Moscow was ready to restore dialog with the USA.
People vaccinated with the COVID-19 nasal vaccine may be allergic and need medical help, thus, the first nasal vaccination points should not be organized in airports and shopping malls.
TASS was informed of this by Sergei Netesov, virologist, RAS corresponding member, Head of the Bionanotechnology, Microbiology and Virology Laboratory, Novosibirsk State University.
Organizing nasal vaccination points in airports and shopping malls is easier, but I would do this only in medical institutions at first.
The reason is the risk of allergic reactions, though minor, but it is desirable that the person sit by the doctor's office for a while afterwards.
Doctors have special allergy relief kits that are effective in just a minute or two, which is sometimes crucial," says Netesov.

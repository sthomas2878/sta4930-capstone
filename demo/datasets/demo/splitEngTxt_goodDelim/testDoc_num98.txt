American scientists determined the weekly volume of alcoholic drinks that increases the risk of cancer.
This was reported by the Daily Express.
Experts concluded that consumption of four or more alcoholic drinks a week is linked with the increased risk of developing oncology.
At the same time, the chance of disease development increases with the increasing amount of alcohol consumed.

Scientists cannot specify the exact reason for such type of oncology, they are just pointing out that certain factors lead to a destructive process for the body.

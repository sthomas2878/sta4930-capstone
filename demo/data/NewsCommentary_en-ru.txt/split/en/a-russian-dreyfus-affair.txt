A Russian Dreyfus Affair
<P>
No secret file is being used to secure a guilty verdict.
The proceedings are held in open court, not in camera.
Yet the trial of Colonel Yuri Budanov in the city of Rostov-on-Don on charges of kidnapping, raping and murdering an 18 year old Chechen girl named Elsa Kungaeva contains echoes of the notorious Dreyfus affair that divided France a century ago.
<P>
At that time, the French army was licking its wounds from the defeat at Sedan and the creation of Bismarck's imperial Germany.
In the words of one of the French novelist Anatole France's characters in a novel written at the time, esteem for the army "is all that is left of our glorious past.
It consoles us for the present and gives us hope of the future."
An exaggerated sense of lost glory helped incite the French Army to fake the evidence that convicted Captain Alfred Dreyfus of spying for the Kaiser.
<P>
Today's Russian army is not the bastion of reactionary monarchism and anti-Semitism that shaped French officers' behavior in the Dreyfus affair.
But the army's bitter resentiment at the demise of Russia's superpower status, reinforced by the military's own humiliating loss of resources and prestige, is no less evident.
The army's exalted, tormented, and wounded pride appears to be shaping both its response to Budanov's trial as well as that of President Vladimir Putin's Kremlin.
<P>
To Russia's officer corps, all opponents are ipso facto the army's enemies and, by extension, enemies of Russia.
Unlike their turn-of-the-19th-century French counterparts, however, Russia's officer corps is essentially apolitical, despite decades of dictatorship.
<P>
Military officers are not overwhelmingly communist in their political leanings, not exclusively ethnic Russians, and not necessarily nationalists.
Some officers are all of these, and most are some of them.
But the army as a whole is not anti-democratic.
It appears to have mostly learned its lesson about keeping out of politics, having been drawn into the coup against Mikhail Gorbachev in August, 1991, only to switch sides when young officers and conscripts balked at carrying out orders.
<P>
Nevertheless, although President Putin is working to make it a more professional body than the Soviet-era mass army, the officer corps retains a Bolshevik mind-set barricaded against the intrusions of civilian criticism.
Poorly paid, slowly promoted, and often drearily garrisoned in Siberian towns, the army's sole recompense nowadays is prestige: the honors, immunities and cachet of a caste; in short, the esteem in which it is held because of the victories over Napoleon and Hitler.
<P>
Colonel Budanov's trial challenges this ingrained sense of honor.
When the proceedings began a year ago, democratic Russia seemed to be catching up at long last with the civilized world in holding military officers accountable to the rule of law.
Russian liberals initially welcomed the Budanov case as a sign that the country might address accusations that war crimes were committed in Chechnya.
<P>
Last month, however, the military prosecutor accepted Colonel Budanov's argument that he was temporarily insane when he killed the girl, and so acquitted Budanov on the charge of murder.
(The rape charge, for some unclear reason, had already been dropped.)
The prosecution then began to speak of the young girl as a Chechen sniper, from a family of snipers.
<P>
Outraged, Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov dismissed the prosecutor, who seemed ready to acquit the patriotic "hero" on all remaining charges.
A new prosecutor revived the investigation, reinstated the charges, and balked at accepting a plea of not guilty due to insanity.
<P>
Ivanov, however, apparently intervened not because he feared a miscarriage of justice, but because the Kremlin hierarchy recognized that a verdict exonerating Budanov would leave the army itself vulnerable.
Critics would suggest that it had failed to control its men and might even have encouraged and abetted the savagery in Chechnya-of which the charges against Colonel Budanov are but a small part.
<P>
So only a guilty verdict would suffice, but it still had to be qualified with a finding of insanity.
After all, no army can be held accountable for the murderous actions of an insane man.
<P>
No ordinary psychiatrist, however, attested to Budanov's alleged insanity.
Instead, he was evaluated by experts from Moscow's Serbsky Institute of Psychiatry, which became infamous in the Brezhnev era for treating dissent as a form of schizophrenia and subjecting "patients" like Vladimir Bukovsky to psychotropic drugs to help them recognize the glories of Soviet life.
The Serbsky team claimed that Colonel Budanov was temporarily insane at the time of the murder due to "patriotic fervor."
<P>
As in the Dreyfus affair, Russia's army is increasingly a prisoner of its friends-die hard communists, Great Russian chauvinists, ranting nationalists, and all the other anti-reform and anti-democratic groups who make defense of military honor a rallying cry for their own dark causes.
Indeed, the army's honor is now so firmly tied to finding Budanov both guilty and insane that Russia finds itself on the brink of issuing a nakedly political verdict.
Like the Dreyfus affair, so pathetic a distortion of law into propaganda will ultimately leave an even more profound sense of shame, one lasting generations after Budanov's supporters have lost all credibility.

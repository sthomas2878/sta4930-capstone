Is Marxism Really Dead?
<P>
KIEV: A contradictory development is taking place in the post-communist world.
While Marxist ideas are considered outdated, one post-communist party after another wins elections.
Even if other factors play a role, ideas are fundamental in politics.
To the detriment of the reform process in Eastern Europe, Marxist ideas are not as dead as they may seem.
<P>
Often, secondary Marxist thoughts linger on and are accepted as universal prejudices.
Even more treacherous is “reverse Marxism”: since the communists did so, the exact opposite must be true.
In other instances, people wrongly believe the communists achieved their propagated aims.
Finally, many remain intellectual prisoners in the analytical framework of Marxism.
<P>
One fundamental Marxist idea has been the need for the socialization of the means of production.
Hence, liberals have argued that private property is the key to economic reform.
For instance, the Russian writer Boris Mozhaev argued in 1992: “No market economy and no liberalization of prices is possible as long as land is fully owned by the state”.
Yet at that time markets in certain sectors already existed - for example in food: one third of Russia’s food is distributed through private markets - but this reality was hidden under reverse Marxist dogma.
<P>
Hence, the Russian reformers focused on land reform - which is very difficult - rather than the total liberalization of agricultural trade - which is much easier.
As a result the reformers are long lost in the strife over agriculture.
<P>
Similarly, in a Marxist vein, most reformers - and communists - in the former Soviet Union argued that privatization had to precede liberalization, this despite the fact that many Central European countries had failed to de-monopolize and privatize until they liberalized.
Instead, these reformers stuck to the Marxist conviction that property relations were more important than the market, without realizing that this flawed belief was a remnant of Marxism.
<P>
Another fundamental communist tenet has been the concentration of industrial production in a small number of gigantic monopolistic enterprises.
Gigantomania has been universally accepted as a shortcoming of the Soviet-type economy also in the West.
But there is no gigantomania.
The 20 biggest Russian enterprises have a smaller absolute number of employees than the 20 biggest enterprises, not only in the USA and Japan, but also in Germany, France, Italy and Britain.
In a World Bank paper, Anette Brown, Barry Ickes and Randi Ryteman have shown that by US definitions only 0.2 percent manufacturing output is monopolistic.
<P>
Thus, Russia and most other communist countries - save Albania and other small countries - were not uniquely monopolized.
On the contrary, they had a uniquely competitive industrial structure.
Today, factories have to be closed down all over, because usually there are too many in the same branch, and specialization is too limited.
<P>
However the alleged production monopolies were used by state enterprise managers as an argument against liberalization of prices and trade, and they often won.
If the production structure had been properly understood, the recipe would have been far-reaching liberalization - as in Poland.
<P>
Similarly, the monopolistic structure was alleged to render monetary policy ineffective.
Wherever that argument has been accepted, inflation has been far higher than were it has been refuted.
Today, we can see that greater money supply has invariably led to higher inflation, exactly as the quantity theory of money teaches us.
<P>
A typical example of the danger of lingering Marxist values is the production fetishism and contempt for trade as “speculation”.
In the bad old days, only 7 percent of the Soviet labor force worked in trade, compared with 15-20 percent in the West, because trade was considered “unproductive”.
<P>
Yet, what is the point of producing goods few want, that are not available and might rot away before they reach the consumer?
To reduce such problems, many need to work well in trade.
Traders help people to find what they really need, and obviously they should be paid for such services.
The massive development of spontaneous trade after the liberalization of the prices and trade made an important contribution to welfare, but many saw it as big waste.
<P>
Conversely, Marxism did not value finance, and the popular understanding of the benefits of the swiftly developing financial sector and capital markets remains limited, unfortunately.
<P>
Finally, Marxism leaves intolerance of the real functioning of markets.
A “spontaneous market” remains a term of abuse, although it means fruitful decentralization and sound competition.
State planning has failed.
The market develops from top down, initially focusing on luxury goods, such as perfumes, electronics and expensive cars in big cities.
Only after a thorough penetration and saturation of the market will comparatively unprofitable sales of matches and salt in rural areas develop.
<P>
The market develops according to its own logic, and capitalism implies an understanding of the market’s nature and of how society can benefit from the market.
Lingering Marxist ideas are a dangerous barrier to understanding the reform process and the working of a capitalistic market economy.

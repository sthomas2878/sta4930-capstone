Taming Politicians on Both Sides of the Atlantic
<P>
Despite occasional grumbles from politicians, no one seriously doubts the European Central Bank's independence, or that monetary policy within the euro zone is therefore well insulated from political pressures.
But the recent death of the Stability and Growth Pact-killed off by Germany, its father, with France acting as co-conspirator and willing accomplice-reminds us of a key lesson: elected politicians find it hard, if not impossible, to relinquish substantial power in the area of fiscal policy.
<P>
The same is true across the Atlantic.
The US Federal Reserve Board is, of course, very independent.
But any attempt to limit the fiscal discretion of America's Federal government in the manner of the Stability Pact-for example, the infamous Gramm/Rudman rules of the Clinton era-always collapse in the end in the face of presidential and congressional pressure.
<P>
Monetary policy can be used to stimulate an economy just as much as fiscal policy, if not more, in election years, which politicians will always want to do.
But reckless use of either mechanism for short-term goals may create long-term costs, justifying some restrictions on politicians' latitude in influencing macroeconomic policies.
<P>
When politicians can control inflation by exercising decisive sway over central banks, they can use their power to devalue the burden of public debt, avoiding the need for more taxation to pay it off.
This was the great lesson of the 1970's and early 1980's, when rampant inflation forced politicians to surrender this power to independent central banks, which alone could convince markets that price stability would be restored.
<P>
Yet monetary policy is not a unique species of economic policymaking.
Aspects of fiscal policy could also be delegated to independent bureaucrats in order to keep politicians in line.
Why not, for example, entrust an independent bureaucracy with some redistributive goals or control over the level of public investment or deficit management?
An independent fiscal authority could arguably implement a society's long-term goals in these areas better than politicians, who have their eyes on the next election.
<P>
Indeed, as a matter of principle, it is not clear why monetary policy and fiscal policy should be treated so differently, with one completely delegated to a bureaucratic agency and the other completely discretionary and in the hand of politicians.
So why do we see this large difference in reality in both America and Europe?
<P>
The answer is that fiscal policy is the key tool politicians use to attract and maintain the support of a winning coalition of voters, say retirees, public employees, and middle-class homeowners, while imposing the costs on the losers.
It is not necessary to please 100% of the voters, only enough to win.
The fiscal card is critical in choosing which groups of voters to buy.
<P>
Independent fiscal authorities-or fiscal rules such as the Stability Pact-stand in the way of this political use of fiscal policy, which is costly.
After all, if politicians could not win elections by taking money from some-including future generations, which will have to foot a portion of the bill-and giving it to others, they would have to work much harder to display some ability in producing public benefits for all.
This is far more difficult!
<P>
Of course, monetary policy also has redistributive effects.
Think about the different effects of interest rates on debtors versus creditors.
However, monetary policy is a much more awkward, indirect and imprecise way of choosing winners and losers than fiscal policy.
Independent central banks can occasionally be a pain for politicians, but at least they can be used as scapegoats when necessary-a role whose political benefits outweigh the costs of losing control over a useful tool.
<P>
These considerations should guide the choice of what will follow the Stability Pact in Europe.
It is now abundantly clear that national governments (especially those of large countries) will never accept substantial limitations on their fiscal discretion.
They may have suspended their freedom of fiscal maneuver long enough to launch the euro, but in normal times, national governments will reclaim their fiscal turf.
So the European Commission should stop fighting a rearguard battle that merely weakens its credibility, especially in the eyes of small countries, which are the only ones that can be bullied into accepting unwanted fiscal rules.
<P>
Realistically, all that the Commission can ask of European national governments is for transparency and clarity in their fiscal accounts.
Preventing the political use of fiscal policy is an impossible task.
But at least a country's fiscal actions should not be hidden in its budgets' obscure methodological footnotes.
<P>
Even this limited goal may not be easy to achieve.
A strategic lack of transparency is the bread and butter of shrewd politicians who want to please a lobby by hiding the costs of the public's largesse from the majority of citizens.
<P>
The rules that govern politicians' behavior must not be written as if disinterested, well-intentioned public servants will apply them.
Politicians are willing to go to great lengths to please their supporters and win elections.
The best that we can plausibly hope for is to ensure that the worst of what they do is done out in the open.

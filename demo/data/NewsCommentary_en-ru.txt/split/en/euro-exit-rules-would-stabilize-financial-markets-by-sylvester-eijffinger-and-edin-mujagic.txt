The Eurozone’s Uncertainty Principle
<P>
TILBURG – If there is one thing that financial markets detest, it is prolonged uncertainty.
But, since the eurozone crisis began, policymaking in the monetary union has become increasingly unpredictable.
Early private-sector involvement in supporting the troubled eurozone countries was unexpected.
The recent deal to save Cyprus, which includes forced losses on large depositors, was similarly surprising – and is threatening to damage further the eurozone’s already-delicate relationship with financial markets.
<P>
A previous proposal suggests that not even insured deposits of less than €100,000 ($129,000) are safe.
Although Cypriot lawmakers decisively rejected the plan to impose a one-time tax of almost 7% on such deposits only a couple of days after it was presented, the damage has been done.
People in Spain, Portugal, and other troubled eurozone countries now fear for their savings should their country need emergency loans from its partners.
<P>
Unpredictability could damage the eurozone even more than the crisis itself.
Large-scale capital flight from the eurozone’s weaker economies would put them in dire straits, forcing their partners to provide even more emergency assistance, while capital flight from the eurozone as a whole could destabilize even its strongest economies, bringing the monetary union closer to a chaotic breakup.
Moreover, by undermining confidence, unexpected measures can drive citizens to vote for populist leaders, adding political uncertainty to Europe’s challenges.
<P>
Paradoxically, the eurozone’s strict anti-exit policy is a major source of volatility.
With no mechanism for orderly exit in place, the prospect of a chaotic departure by one or more countries petrifies financial markets and destabilizes the entire monetary union.
<P>
This gives troubled eurozone countries the upper hand in negotiations and enables them to flout agreed measures.
For example, Greece was granted its first bailout in 2010 on the condition that it carry out large-scale privatization; though it has sold off few assets since then, it still received the money.
And, when Greece repeatedly missed its debt and deficit targets, its European partners extended new loans with longer repayment periods and lower interest rates.
<P>
Similarly, Italy promised various reforms in exchange for support by the European Central Bank, which agreed to purchase Italian government debt in the secondary market, thereby lowering the country’s long-term interest rates.
But, as soon as the ECB started buying Italian bonds, Italy reneged on its promises – and the ECB continued to buy its bonds.
<P>
More recently, Cyprus voted down the bailout agreement that the government had concluded with its eurozone partners, without a single vote in favor.
Indeed, not even the imminent threat of financial meltdown could convince any member of Cyprus’s parliament to accept the mandatory levy on individual bank deposits.
<P>
In short, eurozone leaders, gripped by fear of an exit, have repeatedly resorted to ad hoc measures to keep even non-compliant countries in the euro.
But, in order to eliminate uncertainty, the eurozone must break the taboo on exits, establishing clear criteria for a country’s departure and outlining the process by which it should occur.
<P>
The prospect of a forced exit would restore balance to the eurozone by giving member countries a strong incentive to follow the rules, while taking away their disproportionate bargaining power.
Objective criteria and a clear strategy would reassure financial markets that an exit would be orderly and predictable, thereby deterring capital flight.
<P>
The alternative is to continue on the current path, which has led to six of 17 eurozone members being helped in some way – such as through emergency lending or large-scale bond purchases by the ECB – since the euro crisis began.
If eurozone leaders do not change their approach, Slovenia is likely to be the seventh.
<P>
Even seemingly stable economies are at risk.
Luxemburg has sound finances, but its large financial sector could be a time bomb in the heart of the eurozone.
Belgium is politically unstable, France has lost its triple-A credit rating from Moody’s, and both have massive public debt and lackluster growth prospects.
The banking system in Austria – supposedly one of the eurozone’s core economies – is highly exposed to central and eastern Europe.
<P>
This leaves only Germany, the Netherlands, and Finland.
While they are in relatively good shape – for example, Germany is presenting a balanced budget this year and is the only Western country whose debt has fallen slightly – they cannot keep the eurozone afloat on their own.
<P>
In order to save the eurozone, its leaders must establish a credible threat of a forced exit and devise a predictable strategy for carrying it out.
Given the likelihood that the threat alone would be enough to eliminate the need to enforce it, the outcome would probably not differ from that of the current approach.
But the new strategy would make a world of difference in reassuring financial markets and stabilizing the eurozone in the long run.

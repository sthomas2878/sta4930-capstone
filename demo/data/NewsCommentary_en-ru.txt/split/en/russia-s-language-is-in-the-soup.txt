Russia's Language is in the Soup
<P>
Three hundred years ago Peter the Great cut a window into Europe.
Foreign languages flooded into Russia: English, Dutch, French, and Italian.
Today, new words and cultural concepts are also arriving in Russia at breathtaking speed.
Sometimes they add to, sometimes they replace, Russian analogues.
<P>
For example, Russia has had "shti" (cabbage soup), "ukha" (fish soup), "pokhlebka" (everything soup), "selyanka" (peasant soup), "botviniya" (cold beet soup), "okroshka" (spring vegetable soup).
Now bullion, consomm√©, and even simply "soup" have arrived.
There was less, now we have more.
Isn't this good?
<P>
But somebody thinks that all the old words should be deleted from our memories, that only one word -- soup -- should remain.
Soup; soup in general, with no variations.
Everything we eat with a spoon is soup; everything we eat with a fork is not soup.
In all our menus we have soup - just that.
<P>
Forget what you've known, never remember, never try to find out what words like gazpacho or bouillabaisse might mean.
Don't ask what ingredients are used in making those dishes.
You don't need to know all this.
In fact, why be concerned about the foreign gazpacho?
Forget even a simple difference between the "shchi" (cabbage soup) and the "borshch" (beet soup).
There is none.
"Ukha" (fish soup), what is "ukha?"
With all sorts of fish available, let's eliminate the word for it.
Why use a name when we have a product?
<P>
Let all of those concepts disappear, evaporate; let only "soup" remain -- eat it, that's it.
Clothes, too, are now generic in today's Russia, as in China under Mao--a blue fatigue.
Let's live in "khroushchobas" (five-story uniform buildings built in the 1950-1960s during Khrushchev's leadership).
Let all men be Sashas and all women Natashas.
If we need to address them, we can simply say, "Eh!"
<P>
Under free market capitalism we can, at long last, live up to the communist ideal, "The whole Soviet nation like one man!"
Excellent synonyms like "good, beautiful, valuable, positive, lovely, exceptional, super, enchanted, magic, adorable, remarkable, sweet, perfect, spectacular, fantastic, great, grandiose, irresistible, intriguing, entertaining, luring, incomparable, attractive, striking, divine," are disappearing.
What do we have nowadays?
Only "krutoi" (cool), or "klevyi" (hot).
<P>
It is really "cool", for example, to express oneself with just one-syllable words, selectively adopted from all the treasures of the English language.
At this very moment your author is staring with disgust at a cardboard box on which some American has written: "Parm Plus!
New Improved Taste."
What he really wanted to say, of course, was that "This box contains Parmesan Cheese, which because of the newly added ingredients is infinitely better than other cheeses produced by our vicious competitors."
<P>
This surgery resulted in the amputation of a perfectly healthy part of the word "parmesan," adding the empty but pompous suffix "plus."
Think of this action as akin to a surgery that replaces a healthy leg with an artificial limb.
<P>
Some inexplicable and unsurpassable force makes our journalists (especially young television and radio types), cut out whole bunches of Russian suffixes and throw them into the trash.
"Blef-klub" (Bluff Club) for example is shown on "Kultura" TV.
Its hosts and producers seem deaf to the nauseating connotations - vomit, nausea, and illness - that the word "blef" (blev) has in Russian.
<P>
We must remember that despite the IMF, the World Banks, and all the market economic phenomena we have experienced in the last decade, Russian bread cannot grow in a foreign style.
Economy of sounds and words does not work for the Russian language.
Using English-speaking models we no longer get the slow, sequential flow of the Russian linguistic stream but a competition for asthmatics.
<P>
The new generation, it seems, prefers new models of verbal exchange, not as enchanting as in the past, but perfectly suited to the simple communications required in today's simplified world.
Everywhere people gripe about how teenagers grunt and do not speak.
Here in Russia, grunting is all we now seem to do.
This is what it a typical modern Russian conversation sounds like.
<P>
A restaurant scene (words used in both Russian and English version are italicized):
<P>
Client: I want soup .
<P>
Waiter: Here is soup .
<P>
C: Is soup hot ?
<P>
W: Hot plus .
<P>
C: (eating) Eh ?!?!
<P>
W: Mhhh ?
<P>
C: Soup is not hot .
<P>
W: No?
Not hot ?
Then it's cool .
<P>
C: Not cool.
Soup --out.
<P>
W: Well, it's one buck .
<P>
C: Go to hell!
Here is ruble plus .
<P>
W: Eh!
Ruble is shit.
Give me a buck .
<P>
C: No!
<P>
W: I'll give you a black eye plus .
Give me a buck .
<P>
C: Here (punches a waiter in the eye)
<P>
W: Mhhh!
<P>
C: I saved a buck (runs away).
<P>
This language can be used not only by male silent types, but also by lovely chirping ladies.
Here is a beauty parlor scene (based on a true story).
A lady enters with a fashion magazine.
<P>
Hairdresser: So?
<P>
Lady: Cut.
<P>
H: How?
<P>
L: Like here.
Boxer -cut.
<P>
H: (approvingly) Boxer is cool .
<P>
L: So...
<P>
H: So how was Cypru s?
<P>
L: (perking up) O, Cyprus was cool .
Beach, bar --all plus, juice, gin, drink .
At night--husband into the douche , daughter--out, here is Greek Max -- knock, knock , then sex , cake, bucks, kreks, feks, peks .
So here.
<P>
At this point your author runs away, in despair, in search of the few remaining Russians who still converse in their native language.

The Delusion of Debt Forgiveness
<P>
ROME: Governments from around the world will gather in Brussels under UN auspices on May 14th to discuss the plight of poor countries.
As they talk, the leaders of rich countries may strike a self-satisfied pose, recalling as they do the old proverb, which says that forgiveness is divine.
For little more than a year ago they agreed to forgive much of the debt of the world’s poorest countries.
Of course, forgiving the debts of the poor is undoubtedly noble.
Sadly, not everything that is noble is smart and effective.
<P>
Many of the debts of poor countries that have been forgiven were already considered as, de facto, lost and thus unrecoverable.
Interest and principal payments made by many poor countries were, as a result of this, much smaller than what was actually owed.
Ethiopia, for example, was paying a sum equal to 10% of its exports; payments of 70% would have been needed to cover the nominal value of its debt.
<P>
The Cologne Agreement on poor countries with the highest level of debt – the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative – that was agreed to last year declared that debts will be forgiven up to the point at which interest payments become “sustainable”: in other words, the agreement substitutes unrecoverable debt for a debt load that is nominally lower but “real.”
According to calculations by Britain’s Treasury, with the HIPC agreement Mozambique pays about the same proportion in debt service as it was paying before the accord was signed.
<P>
More than a shell game is at work here, however.
For the countries accorded debt forgiveness under the HIPC must renounce other forms of aid.
This restriction led Ghana to ask to opt out of the HIPC altogether.
<P>
Uncertainty about the numbers involved in the exercise in debt forgiveness is large, but reliable World Bank calculations show that, for the 9 countries in the most advanced stages of HIPC, interest expenditures should go down to 10% of the value of exports.
This amounts to a saving of about 1.4% of GDP – the actual number will perhaps be larger by a few decimal points here and there when the effects of bilateral debt forgiveness are added.
A respectable outcome, but not an enormous amount.
<P>
Independent of these numbers, however, the debt forgiveness debate perpetuates the legend that the West is responsible for the oppressive debt burdens of poor countries, and, more generally, for the scarcity of assistance to help them fight poverty.
The reality is the opposite.
Few developing countries are seriously engaged in fighting poverty.
In many of them, public expenditure favor the middle and upper middle classes; above all, it favors city dwellers.
<P>
Economies in most poor countries, indeed, are rigged against their own poor in a variety of ways:
<P>
• by artificially inflated public employment: with high salaries being paid to state workers relative to the average wage, state jobs often provide lifetime employment for children of the middle classes;
<P>
• because pensions are available only for a few executives in the formal sector and for state employees, with nothing provided to the rural poor;
<P>
• because free university education is a form of redistribution from poor to rich because the poor are taxed to pay for university, but rarely get to go;
<P>
• because expenditures for primary education often end up being captured by teachers’ unions in order to guarantee privileges for their members;
<P>
• through health expenditures that are often concentrated on hospitals in relatively prosperous and politically important urban areas;
<P>
• because free water and electricity are mostly a subsidy for the urban middle class and for rich farmers.
<P>
Overwhelming empirical evidence (provided in large part by the World Bank, a place keen on the idea of aid) proves that the development of the poorest countries is blocked, primarily, by government inefficiency and the corruption.
For development to take off, countries require moderately stable and efficient governments pursuing appropriate economic policies.
South Korea is the best example of what can be achieved in this way.
In 1960, it had a per capita income lower than Somalia; today it is a member of the OECD.
<P>
Empirical research amply demonstrates that development assistance is largely ineffective because it is given indiscriminately to governments who use it to enrich a tiny elite.
A recent document by a World Bank expert, William Easterly, shows that the same conclusion also holds for debt forgiveness initiatives.
<P>
Of course, the West is not blameless.
It erred in giving too much credit, not too little, to poor countries, and by handing out credit according to political needs rather than by rigorous criteria related to fighting poverty.
The ex-imperial powers favored their ex-colonies, regardless of whether they deserved assistance or how they used it.
During the Cold War, alliance loyalty rather than economic motivations, determined the flow of aid.
A corrupt but allied government was invariably preferred to an honest, non-allied one.
<P>
In addition, many of the bilateral credits now being canceled were in reality commercial credit guarantees which benefitted businesses in creditor countries more than poor countries.
In Italy, things were even worse: development assistance was largely disbursed in order to favor foreign friends of Italian politicians.
<P>
So debt forgiveness, even if morally commendable, risks sending two misleading messages: it tells the ruling classes of poor debtor countries that corruption pays; and it reinforces the Western public’s belief that the problems of poor countries are caused by Western policies.
If these two points are not confronted, debt forgiveness will end up laying the foundations for a new cycle of indebtedness, corruption, and abiding poverty.

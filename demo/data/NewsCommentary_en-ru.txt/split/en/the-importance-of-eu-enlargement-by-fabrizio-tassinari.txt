The EU’s Forgotten Foundations
<P>
COPENHAGEN – Twenty years ago this month, in Copenhagen, the European Council established the eligibility requirements for joining the European Union.
But, with the EU navigating the severest economic crisis since its creation, one might wonder whether this anniversary is an occasion for lamentation rather than celebration.
<P>
In fact, it is the EU’s economic struggles that make it particularly important this month to reaffirm the so-called Copenhagen Criteria – which facilitated significant EU enlargement – as a highly consequential codification of countries’ transition to market-based liberal democracy.
Adopted just over a year after the Soviet Union’s dissolution, the criteria served as a bold symbol of Europe’s escape from superpower politics and freedom to define its own future.
<P>
The ambition of the former Soviet-bloc countries of Central and Eastern Europe to join the EU, which they considered essential to their economic and political transformation, is a testament to the EU’s most extraordinary power – that of attraction.
The unwavering support of the United States, together with the expansion of NATO, facilitated the EU’s pursuit of one of the most profound ideas driving the development of civilization – that free trade and mobility among societies is the best route to peace and stability.
<P>
The EU advanced this idea further at the European Council in Thessaloniki – the tenth anniversary of which is also this month – when, after a decade of violent conflict in the Balkans, it opened the EU accession path for Yugoslavia’s successor states.
EU leaders made a firm commitment to accept countries that were ready for reconciliation and development, judging each on its own merit.
<P>
Today, the Western Balkans is the only area of Europe’s geographical core yet to be incorporated into the EU.
For these countries, it is mostly a question of how quickly they can fulfill the Copenhagen Criteria.
<P>
If there is any doubt that Europe’s recipe for peace is still effective, consider the April 19 agreement on the normalization of relations between Serbia and Kosovo – an important step toward resolving one of Europe’s most intractable ethnic-territorial deadlocks.
The EU’s mediating role – specifically, that of its top foreign-policy official, Catherine Ashton – was critical to success.
<P>
Regardless of the EU’s ongoing economic struggles, the populations of Serbia and Kosovo, like their neighbors, remain convinced that joining a wealthy club of more than 500 million people is better than getting left behind in the EU’s impoverished backyard.
Croatia’s membership, which will become official next month, is powerful evidence of Europe’s continued promise.
<P>
And yet, if enlargement is regarded as the zenith of the European project, this would suggest that the process also contains the seeds of the EU’s decline.
As debates about the EU’s “absorption capacity” highlight, the EU will eventually reach its geographical limits.
Nonetheless, the real threat is political, as waning support for admitting Turkey, a large Muslim country, demonstrates.
<P>
Moreover, although the enlargement process is intended to accompany and support democratic transitions, it continues to be steered by institutions whose democratic legitimacy is often questioned.
A country’s progress toward accession is determined by the number of boxes ticked in the European Commission’s annual report.
<P>
Unless political leaders deliberately enshrine Europe in a narrative of modernization and democratization, citizens will increasingly overlook the long-term concrete benefits of EU integration.
Worse, they will become more inclined to give credence to populists’ claims that the EU is responsible for any domestic setback.
<P>
This dynamic has characterized the management of the euro crisis.
The fact that unelected representatives of the European Commission, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund are responsible for the surveillance of austerity policies has led to a severe social and political backlash in the eurozone’s periphery.
<P>
Viewed in this light, the main lesson of EU enlargement concerns the sources, means, and objectives of democratic governance in an increasingly complex world.
For all of its limitations, the EU’s foundational significance consists in the link between liberal democracy and the quest for security.
The enlargement process is an imperfect embodiment of this nexus.
<P>
At a time of somber introspection, nurturing an understanding of the EU’s purpose – a purpose reflected in the Copenhagen Criteria – is essential, for the sake of existing and aspiring members alike.

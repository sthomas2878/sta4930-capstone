Feudalism and Futility in Romania
<P>
BUCHAREST: Months of political infighting in Romania seemingly ended with the recent, not-so-unexpected resignation of Prime Minister Viktor Ciorbea.
Little more than a year after he led the country’s "democratic forces" to stunning parliamentary and presidential victories, the ruling coalition of Christian-Democrats, liberals, social-democrats, and ethnic Hungarians now seems on the brink of disintegration.
Although the ex-Prime minister had been held personally responsible for his government's failure to follow through on its ambitious economic reforms, that failure goes far deeper than one man.
<P>
Last year's bright hopes for an economic upturn have vanished.
Salaries now lag so far behind prices that most people cannot meet their everyday needs.
In 1997 GDP dropped by 7%, hitting hard the already meager state budgets for health and education.
Enterprises, even private and relatively efficient ones, suffer because of slack demand.
Despite some acceleration of the privatization process -- not hard to achieve given that little privatization took place under the former regime of President Ion Iliescu -- no state banks have been privatized, and large state companies like Romanian Railways (SNCFR), and the National Electricity Company (RENEL) blithely continue to pile up huge unpaid debts.
<P>
To cope with these gargantuan economic challenges, Romania required a determined cabinet, a united parliamentary majority, and a clear, resolute roadmap for reform.
It has had none of these.
Although Ciorbea's goodwill, personal honesty, and commitment to reform remain undisputed, he was a man of weak resolve, blown this way and that by President Constantinescu and other leaders in the coalition cabinet.
<P>
But personal shortcomings alone did not undo Ciorbea’s government.
Rather, a pervasive confusion about what really is at stake in the process of reforming Romania’s economy, institutions, and society is at the heart of this failure.
Our shortsighted politicians are captives of their momentary and monetary interests; our journalists prefer scandal to the hard slog of investigation and analysis.
Few people are willing to go beyond superficial approaches to politics and reporting on politics, at least not while rooting out scapegoats remains so rewarding an activity.
<P>
This superficiality results from the fact that, though communism was a thoroughly "modern" notion, modernity in Romania goes only skin deep.
At the 20th century’s close, Romania (like Bulgaria, Russia, Ukraine, and other heavily Sovietized societies) appears more like a 'neo-feudal' state than a modern society.
For here is a state where groups, classes, even individuals struggle for privileges that are granted, not according to talent and work, but rather according to the status of the group in which one belongs.
<P>
State banks, state approved public societies (trade unions, for example), large state enterprises, act little differently in Romania today than feudal guilds behaved in medieval Europe.
At the whim of the state, for example, they can be exonerated from paying taxes, or have their posts and work made unchallengeable by law.
<P>
If you own a small shop, or other private business, you must pay your taxes (and usually more than your "fair" share) precisely, and on time.
If you direct a large state company, however, you need not do so, even if your plant owes millions of dollars.
You just visit the minister of finances with your factory’s union leader at your side.
All you need do then is remind the minister of the thousands of people who might take to the streets if the state does not give up claims to the taxes it is due.
Of course, the deficit your plant generates must be covered somehow, and it will be -- by gouging the same small taxpayer once again.
<P>
Romania’s new class of tax-exempt barons -- its directocrats – now control the main economic resources of the country, carrying out their own policies and resisting (usually with success) any and all attempts to abolish their privileges and destroy their castles.
They know how to keep trade unions, as well as a large part of the mass-media, loyal to them.
<P>
Politicians in all the parties that have held power since the fall of Ceausescu are deeply involved in perpetuating and administering this new model feudalism.
Under Iliescu, the spoils went to members of the old nomenklatura; today, directorships and other top posts in important banks and industries are distributed among the coalition parties and their cronies.
Whenever a party controls a high economic post or a government department, it sees to it that the officers carry the "owning" party's card.
<P>
In Romania there are few, if any, autonomous technocrats of the sort who pushed the transition from communism ahead in so many countries.
There is no bureaucracy able to assert and maintain its independence according to law.
In Max Weber's terms, the attributes of a real modern state are barely in embryonic form in Romania.
<P>
Given Romania's neo-feudalism, it is small wonder that reform manifestos promoted by individual political leaders are frail things easily waylaid by the baronial claims of recalcitrant groups.
But so long as Romanian political power flows along the lines of group privilege and economic benefices, all attempts to push reform forward will fall far short of their mark.
<P>
A liberal republic in the truest meaning of the word -- i.e. a state where immutable privileges are suppressed -- is what the Romanian political class should be aiming at.
Unfortunately, that very sort of modern "republic" is also what this class most seems to hate, for it most threatens their privileges.
Across the world, the first "modern" century is coming to its end; in Romania, after decades of communism and seven years of ersatz postcommunism, real "modernity," sadly, has scarcely begun.

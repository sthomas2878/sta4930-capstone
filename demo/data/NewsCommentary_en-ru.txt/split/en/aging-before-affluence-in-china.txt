Aging Before Affluence in China
<P>
BEIJING – Just how fast is China’s population aging, and what does a lower proportion of working-age people mean for the country’s economic development?
Can – and should – anything be done, particularly to the country’s “one child” policy, to slow the trend?
<P>
Nowadays, most demographic predictions for China are based on the country’s total fertility rate (TFR) of 1.8 – unchanged for 20 years.
But population-survey data published by the National Bureau of Statistics suggests that the TFR has been lower than 1.5 for many years, and the United Nations’ newly published report, World Fertility Patterns 2009, revises China’s TFR to 1.4 in 2006, placing it among low-fertility countries.
<P>
A long period of low fertility means that China’s population is aging and growth in the working-age population is slowing.
According to the UN, the working-age population will stop growing in 2015, while the share of the population that is 65 and older will rise to 9.6% (130 million people), up sharply from 6.8% in 2000.
<P>
Since the reform period began in the early 1980’s, a large working-age cohort has ensured a sufficient supply of labor and a high saving rate.
The declining ratio of the dependent population (children and the elderly) to the working-age population (16-64 years old) contributed 26.8% to per capita GDP growth in 1982-2000.
But, according to conservative estimates, the dependency ratio will stop falling in 2013 and then begin rising.
<P>
Population aging is a universal law of economic development and its accompanying social transformation.
But China is unique, because it has arrived at a late stage of demographic transition at a relatively early stage in its economic development.
In 2010, 8.3% of China’s population was 65 and older, compared to 7.5% worldwide, while its GDP per capita was only 47.7% of the global average.
South Korea and Thailand will soon face a rising dependency ratio as well, but their per capita GDP is higher than China’s – three times higher in the case of South Korea.
<P>
While China’s dramatic demographic change will weaken its comparative advantage in labor-intensive industries, it has not gained a compensating level of competitiveness in capital- and technology-intensive industries.
As a result, China faces the risk of falling into the “middle-income trap,” which has prevented many other countries from achieving advanced-economy status.
<P>
But sound policies can help China avoid such a trap.
Under the assumption of labor scarcity and diminishing returns to capital, economic growth cannot be sustained unless total factor productivity (TFP) increases significantly.
It is urgent, therefore, that China shift from inputs-driven growth to a productivity-driven growth pattern.
<P>
Weak TFP growth caused Japan’s “lost decade” after the country’s demographic dividend disappeared in the early 1990’s; China must bridge some large gaps if it is to avoid a similar fate.
It must improve its human capital, remove institutional barriers to labor mobility, and re-orient government from promoting and managing economic development to creating and maintaining a competitive environment.
<P>
With China’s old comparative advantage of cheap labor diminishing, but its new comparative advantage not yet revealed, domestic consumption is the key to sustaining economic growth.
Although labor shortages have helped push up ordinary workers’ wages, the existing, highly unequal income distribution cannot be altered spontaneously.
A host of public policies will be needed to improve China’s income distribution – and thereby stimulate household consumption.
<P>
Thus, as China’s labor-supply constraints tighten, wages should be determined not only by the relationship between labor supply and demand, but also by labor-market institutions.
For example, collective bargaining not only balances the distribution of productivity gains between employees and employers, but also serves as an institutional platform for resolving labor disputes.
<P>
Moreover, social protection must be extended to migrant workers, whose participation rate in basic medical insurance in 2009 was 13.1%, while 9.8% were covered by the state pension scheme and just 3.7% had unemployment insurance.
This requires removing the main institutional cause: the household registration system (hukou), which bars access to public benefits for migrants without urban residence permits.
<P>
Finally, China’s current family-planning policy should be adjusted in accordance with the demographic situation.
Although social and economic developments are the main forces driving China’s rapid demographic transition, and population aging is an irreversible trend, there still remains scope for policy adjustment in order to balance the future population structure.
Surveys of Chinese families indicate that currently the number of intended children is 1.7 on average, whereas official policy permits 1.5.
That difference creates an opportunity to exploit the potential for increased childbearing in the near future.
<P>
Moreover, China’s “one-child” policy has essentially accomplished its initial goal.
In 1980, when the Chinese leadership formally announced the policy, it explained that, “in 30 years, as the current, extremely intense problem of population growth abates, an alternate population policy shall be carried out.”
That condition has more than been met, legitimizing a policy adjustment today.
<P>
Local experiences in adjusting the one-child policy point the way to reform.
An overwhelming majority of Chinese regions currently allow married couples to give birth to a second child if both husband and wife are only children.
By relaxing the policy further, to allow a second child if either partner is an only child, China would make its looming demographic challenges far more manageable than they appear now.

Under Russian eyes
<P>
Ever since the U.S.S.R's voluntary retreat from its East and
<P>
Central European empire three years ago, the issue of Russian
<P>
relations with this region has been shunted to the side.
East and
<P>
Central Europeans long to unite or reunite with the West.
Most
<P>
Russians seek the same goal, going so far as to forget sometimes
<P>
the existence of the countries that lie in between Europe and
<P>
themselves.
Few voices within Russia recall the need for
<P>
constructive relations with the region; fewer still offer
<P>
positive visions for rebuilding ties.
People seem content to
<P>
live as negligent, or worse, suspicious neighbors.
<P>
Such indifference is not only foolish, it is dangerous.
Two
<P>
50th year anniversaries (of VE Day in Europe, and of the Yalta
<P>
conference that set the terms for the Cold War era) and one
<P>
possibility (of Nato expansion) offer a rare moment to address
<P>
this vacuum in the light of a shared historical understanding.
As
<P>
Presidents Clinton and Mitterrand, Chancellor Kohl and Prime
<P>
Minister Major gather with Boris Yeltsin on May 9 atop the
<P>
Kremlin the issue of security in East and Central Europe, not the
<P>
gunfire in Chechnya or the summons of memory, should be atop the
<P>
agenda.
For the events of 50 years ago explain in large parts
<P>
Russia's vast unease over Nato expansion.
<P>
Some victories, Russians have painfully learned, can be too
<P>
sweeping.
At Yalta Stalin achieved almost all of his demands to
<P>
create a security glacier between the Soviet Union and Germany, a
<P>
nation he knew would be strong again one day soon.
Placing Poland
<P>
under his thumb was Stalin's central demand, and in one of
<P>
history's most infamous episodes, Churchill and Roosevelt granted
<P>
him total victory.
But as the ancient Greeks warned, sometimes
<P>
you can have your wishes fulfilled too completely.
<P>
Desire to strengthen Russia's security position vis-a-vis
<P>
Germany and the West resulted merely in an expansion of Soviet
<P>
totalitarian power.
For years the West was seen as the clear
<P>
loser in this process.
Nowadays Russians are not so sure.
<P>
Yalta turned out to be a mere tactical victory for the
<P>
U.S.S.R. Strategically, the Soviet Union was trapped in a system
<P>
that could not be reformed or renegotiated, eventually losing the
<P>
Cold War and far more territory that Stalin acquired at Yalta.
<P>
Empires, Russians now know, are not cheap.
Beginning in the
<P>
early 1950s the Soviet Union began to subsidize parts of its new
<P>
empire, a situation worsened by the incompetent economy it
<P>
imposed throughout the region.
The U.S.S.R. paid even higher
<P>
costs in its military confrontation with America and the West.
<P>
The arms race, as well as a perennially malfunctioning economy,
<P>
incited not only the collapse of communism, but of the Soviet
<P>
Union itself.
<P>
Moreover, the main prize won at Yalta -- the security
<P>
glacier between Russia and the West -- proved illusory almost
<P>
immediately.
For the first decade of the Cold War era,
<P>
demobilization and economic uncertainty meant that the West could
<P>
not even think about threatening Soviet security.
And the
<P>
glacier was useless as a shield against nuclear onslaught, though
<P>
as an alliance of democratic states Nato never had neither the
<P>
capacity nor will to mount an offensive war.
By the second half
<P>
of the 1950s, when Nato developed a meaningful conventional
<P>
warfare capability, the U.S.S.R. was able to deploy tactical
<P>
nuclear weapons, making any theoretical advantage on the ground
<P>
on the plains of Europe meaningless.
<P>
With ups and downs, the military balance in Europe favored
<P>
the Warsaw Pact countries in the decades that followed.
Direct
<P>
confrontation, thusly, was less of a prospect as it became ever
<P>
more ruinous in costs for the Soviet regime.
As the reality of
<P>
the U.S.S.R's position sunk in, it became harder and harder to
<P>
raise the old bogey of western imperialism as a way to inspire
<P>
belief in a communist system decaying from within.
<P>
In freeing Russians from the costs of empire, the defeat of
<P>
three years ago now seems like a victory to many thinking
<P>
Russians.
East and Central Europeans were freed to restart their
<P>
histories, but so were Russians.
Imperial subsidies ceased; the
<P>
foundations for friendly and beneficial relations with the
<P>
Western world were lain.
And the strategic position -- a 1,500
<P>
km zone of neutrality offered Russia an ideal security as
<P>
problems of economic reform crowded out military issues.
To
<P>
conceive of a new military threat on the continent seemed almost
<P>
obscene.
<P>
Rapid demilitarization of European politics and economics
<P>
became a realistic possibility, not a pipedream.
Indeed, Russia
<P>
at long last was poised to solve two problems that had bedeviled
<P>
it since the age of Peter the Great: the threat from the West and
<P>
the threat of being isolated from the West.
<P>
Erosion of this zone of independence threatens to deprive
<P>
Russians of their biggest gain from the Cold War's demise.
<P>
Mutual suspicions between Russia and the West are returning, as a
<P>
new continental competition for mastery threatens to break out as
<P>
not only East and Central Europe, but Ukraine and the Baltic
<P>
states become targets for membership in two new competing blocs.
<P>
Even the hint of such a shift causes Russian friends of the West
<P>
to give pause.
No one but fanatics or those nostalgic for the
<P>
Cold War could possibly welcome such a development.
<P>
Nato expansion will inevitably bring Russian xenophobes and
<P>
nationalists to the forefront of Russian politics.
This is why
<P>
the West's best friends in Russia lead the fight against quick
<P>
Nato expansion.
Nationalists and communists secretly, and
<P>
Vladimir Zhirinovsky openly, laud this prospect as their easiest
<P>
route into power.
<P>
The desire of East and Central European nations to become
<P>
part and parcel of the Western political and economic system is
<P>
well understood by most Russians; even their desire to receive
<P>
firm and fixed security guarantees are not condemned out of hand.
<P>
Very few, if any, Russians are interested in exercising any
<P>
control over this region.
After all, Russians want to be part of
<P>
the same European security system, too.
<P>
This is why Russians ask: Why Nato first?
The unease and
<P>
isolation of the states of East and Central Europe can be
<P>
addressed in other ways that allow for confidence to be built in
<P>
all places.
What about the promised, but lately almost
<P>
forgotten, idea of expansion of the European Union eastward?
<P>
What about direct bilateral or unilateral Western security
<P>
guarantees for the region?
France has remained an integral
<P>
partner of the West for decades, and yet remains outside Nato's
<P>
unified military command.
Perhaps this French model could be
<P>
adopted to the needs of East and Central Europe.
<P>
Because Nato expansion is the most worrying option for
<P>
Russians, the idea that it must come first invites not a sigh
<P>
that security will be heightened, but a shudder that the long run
<P>
security will once more be put into doubt by too overweening a
<P>
reach by the victors.
Stalin's grab for power at Yalta carried
<P>
with it the seeds of its own destruction.
The lessons of Yalta
<P>
for today stem not from any idea of appeasement, but from the
<P>
desire to reach total victory.
Nato expansion will divide Europe
<P>
between those in, and those out.
That division will soon become
<P>
an unhappy and wary one.
<P>
History is not policy.
But any Nato policy of expansion that
<P>
does not account for Russia's view of history will inevitably
<P>
prove shortsighted.

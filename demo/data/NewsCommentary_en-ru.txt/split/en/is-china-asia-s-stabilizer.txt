Is China Asia’s Stabilizer?
<P>
BEIJING: All eyes this week were focused on President Clinton’s summit meeting with President Jiang Zemin.
Although disagreements between the two men over human rights aroused the most notice, a deep, surprising harmony about Asia’s financial crisis was also on view for those who cared to look.
For while every currency in East and Southeast Asia was devalued recently (some more than once), China’s currency, the RMB, remains steadfast.
Indeed, as Japan’s economy flounders, America -- like most of the world -- praises China’s emergence as a force for stability in the chaos of Asia’s regional economy.
<P>
But can China sustain this "contribution" to regional stability and still take care of its national interests?
Across the Pacific, people fret about the RMB’s continuing stability.
Such fears are unjustified, for it is in China’s interests to keep the RMB from depreciating, particularly given China’s current external conditions.
Because of its large trade surplus ($40 billion in 1997) and increasing foreign exchange reserves ($139.9 billion, equal to 15% of GDP) China is struggling against the pressures of the RMB’s appreciation, rather than depreciation.
<P>
Since Asia’s crisis broke out, China has suffered a sharp decrease in exports to Southeast Asian countries, but has enjoyed increased exports to other markets, such as America and Europe.
In the first quarter of 1998, for example, exports to the US increased by 24%, and exports to European countries increased by about 30%.
As a result, China’s exports in the first quarter of 1998 increased by 12.8%, its trade surplus was $10 billion, up 56% compared to the same period last year.
<P>
This May China did suffer its first monthly fall in exports, by -1.5%.
But China’s imports decreased by even more, dropping 2.8%.
So a trade surplus remains, and foreign exchange reserves continue to grow, and now stand at about $150 billion.
From a purely technical point of view, China is well able to maintain the exchange rate unchanged.
<P>
Regional exports have declined by more 20% since last July; investment from the region into China has fallen too.
Any further decline of the regional market for Chinese exports and/or in investment from the region will worry Chinese policymakers.
Thus stabilization and recovery in all Asia is in China’s interests, even if recovery in those countries which devalued their currencies leads to more intense competition in world markets for China.
<P>
Another factor working against RMB depreciation is that deterioration in China’s balance of payments may not improve China's international competitiveness.
China has over $130 billion in outstanding foreign debts, equal to about 12% of GDP at today's exchange rate.
Depreciation will inflate China's debt burden and increase the costs for additional borrowing that the government may undertake to finance its infrastructure investment projects.
<P>
Depreciation, moreover, may also not improve the competitiveness of Chinese goods either, as up to 40% of China’s exports nowadays are from manufacturing industries using imported parts and materials.
<P>
Complicating the debate is Hong Kong.
Devaluation of China’s currency may have a positive direct impact on Hong Kong because Hong Kong is a net importer from Mainland China.
However, the indirect impacts are negative and risky.
If China devalues it will incite a new round of competitive devaluations across Asia.
In such circumstances, Hong Kong's Dollar would be exposed to another wave of "attacks" from speculators.
Defense of Hong Kong's peg to the US dollar would be more costly than anything experienced so far.
<P>
China would be better-off if it returned to the "managed float" it practiced since 1994 but pushed aside in the wake of Asia's crisis and the need for a stable RMB.
Such flexibility, by allowing for slight incremental changes over time, would provide investors with greater certainty, as it would sweep aside today's worries about whether or not China can keep its exchange rate fixed at today's level or sharply devalue the RMB downward.
<P>
Whether or not China will enjoy such flexibility again depends on regional stability.
So long as Asia remains unstable, the negative impact of RMB devaluation on the regional market for Chinese goods and the Hong Kong dollar will be the primary focus of Chinese policymakers.
But today's willingness to stabilize the regional economy does not mean that China will pay any price for stability, nor that it will do carries these regional burdens forever.
Three factors may cause China to change course:
<P>
1.
If the Japanese yen again falls dramatically, inciting another round of regional devaluations;
<P>
2.
If China's domestic market picks up and demand for imports increases significantly, causing a trade deficit;
<P>
3.
If the Asian economies that devalued their currencies recover and significantly increase their exports and China begins to have a large trade deficit
<P>
Beyond managing the uncertainties surrounding Japan's economy through the rest of this year, the challenge for Chinese policymakers will come when Asian economies start to grow and China’s domestic market heats up because of the government's ambitious infrastructure investments.
If all Asia is not stabilized by that time, it will be very difficult for China to make internationally-minded decisions in their management of the RMB.

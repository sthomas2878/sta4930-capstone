Jose Bove Against the Poor
<P>
Support for increased foreign aid, debt relief and debt forgiveness comes from all sides.
From rock stars, to "anti-globalists," to religious organizations, to various advocates for developing countries, to the UN, the calls are becoming deafening.
<P>
The "story" promoted by the pro-aid movement is simple and appealing.
Global differences in income per capita are too extreme; globalization is increasing income inequality; the poor are becoming progressively poorer and many starve in order to pay their debt.
So more aid is needed, and more debt forgiveness, because the world's rich become rich only at the expense of the world's poor.
Aid and debt forgiveness will lift poor countries out of poverty
<P>
This story is almost completely wrong.
The only part that is true is that differences in per capita income are extreme.
All the rest is false.
Globalization is not responsible for third world poverty.
Corrupt and inefficient governments of developing countries are.
<P>
There is not one shred of evidence showing that more openness to trade increases poverty, but anti-globalists do not let facts interfere with their ideology.
More trade makes both sides of a transaction wealthier.
Even if globalization did increase inequality - a big if - since nobody has shown it convincingly, it still reduces poverty.
That is, it increases the income of both the poor and the rich who trade - more so the rich, of course, yet the poor gain too.
The anti-global alternative is to make both sides poorer.
Inequality may be lower, perhaps, but poverty higher.
What's appealing about that?
<P>
It is not true that poor countries have become poorer.
Many examples exist of countries that lifted themselves out of poverty, from South Korea to Costa Rica to Botswana.
Others squandered the immense wealth of natural resources, say Nigeria or Venezuela, the latter, incidentally, recently adopting protectionist policies.
<P>
There is no evidence that increasing foreign aid to governments in developing countries improves their economic performance and lifts them out of poverty permanently.
In fact, more aid is likely to increase corruption, because it augments the amount of resources over which elites fight.
<P>
The same goes for debt forgiveness: it only encourages countries to borrow more, often for the benefit of local elites.
A recent widely cited book by William Easterly - a former economist at the World Bank and an expert on aid and development - provides a mountain of shocking stories about local elites squandering foreign assistance.
The pro-aid coalition should read it carefully.
<P>
Those who really care about reducing poverty should place blame where it belongs: with governments and bureaucracies in many developing countries, especially in Africa and Latin America.
Traditionally, instead, foreign aid paid no attention to the virtues of the receiving countries and did not discriminate in favor of "good governments."
Donors have typically favored their former colonies, irrespectively of the nature of their regimes.
<P>
One of the worst offenders here is France.
Statistical evidence shows that a hypothetical former colony of France, following hideous policies, with dictatorial and objectionable regimes, would receive much more aid from France than a non-former colony struggling and trying to adopt decent polices.
In other words, France gives almost exclusively to its former colonies, irrespective of how bad their regimes are.
<P>
Aid given by the US has been overly influenced by Middle East politics and, previously, by the Cold War.
Political alliances, indeed, are often more important than the quality of the receiving countries policies as a determinant of the direction of aid giving.
The only donors that directed their aid reasonably well are the Scandinavian countries, whose aid giving is the highest in per capita terms but small as a percentage of the total.
One of the reasons is that these countries did not have colonies and political alliances to support.
<P>
Before providing more aid or debt forgiveness two conditions need to be met.
One is "institutional conditionality:" only governments that show serious progress in reducing inefficiency, robbery of public property and corruption, should receive aid.
<P>
Reasonable ways to measure corruption do exist; we know which countries are more corrupt than others.
This evidence should be used more aggressively by donors to discriminate amongst receivers.
<P>
Unfortunately, in most cases the poorest countries, where aid is most needed, are also the most corrupt.
So a second condition must be applied: in such cases aid flow should be kept completely out of public channels and administered by non-local groups un-associated with local elites and governments.
<P>
Finally, other rich country policies may be much more beneficial than aid.
The main change should be stopping agricultural protection for rich country farmers.
The worst enemies of poor countries are farmers in rich countries.
Defeating the lobby of French farmers that strangles reform of the EU common agricultural policy should be the top priority of Europe's pro-poor coalition.
Instead, anti-globalists care more about the charm of French agricultural towns threatened by globalization, that is, by the agriculture of struggling poor countries.

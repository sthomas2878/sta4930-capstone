The EU Commission is dead,
<P>

LONDON: Europe’s core unifying institutions -- NATO and the European Union -- both find themselves simultaneously in uncharted waters.
NATO’s mission is being redefined by deeds in the former Yugoslavia.
The recent resignation en masse of Jacques Santer and the 19 other members of the European Commission in the wake of a damning report on fraud and mismanagement may unintentionally play the same role in the EU.
<P>
Many people assumed that the eviction of the Santer Commission would permanently weaken it as an institution.
In the circumstances, this seemed a reasonable conclusion.
Yet this reasonableness was mistaken, as was demonstrated by last week’s European summit in Berlin.
<P>
Governments of the member states have no desire to see a weakening of the Commission.
Their choice of Romano Prodi as the President of the new Commission has been explained by some in cynical terms: Jacques Santer, the outgoing President, was a Christian Democrat from a small Northern member state (Luxembourg); the next President had to be a Left-of-Centre politician, from a large member state in the south of the EU.
Romano Prodi fitted the bill and was available.
<P>
As so often in the EU, the cynical explanation is elegant, amusing and wrong.
Romano Prodi’s most important characteristic is not that he is Italian or left-of centre, but that he is a former prime minister of a large member state.
<P>
Other candidates whose names were canvassed included Felipe Gonzales, former prime minister of Spain, and Wim Kok, prime minister of the Netherlands.
The outgoing President, Jacques Santer, had been prime minister of Luxembourg; but the original choice of the member states five years ago, until vetoed for stupid reasons by British prime minister John Major, had been Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgium’s prime minister.
<P>
The Berlin summit confirms the general principle that the Presidency of the European Commission is now such a priority that no-one is likely to be considered as a candidate unless he or she has reached the rank of prime minister.
<P>
Prodi’s appointment also sets a new precedent in promoting the President of the Commission to a position head and shoulders above his colleagues.
This is partly a result of the 1997 Amsterdam Treaty, which will give him a key role in the selection of the other 19 Commissioners, and of allocating their portfolios between them.
<P>
The central point of this crisis was the determined bid by the European Parliament to grab new, uncovenanted powers to criticise and censure individual Commissioners, not just the Commission as a collegiate body.
Formally, it still does not have a legal right to discipline individual Commissioners.
But the struggle which led to the resignation of the Commission implies that such a power is operationally within reach.
There seems little doubt that the new process of committee hearings, at which individual Commissioners can be grilled, could have the effect of prising apart the members of the Commission.
<P>
The combination of these factors will strengthen the position of the Commission President.
If individual Commissioners are vulnerable to targeted criticisms of the European Parliament, it follows almost automatically that the new Commission President could, for the first time, have the power to discipline, demote and even sack his 19 colleagues.
This will be a revolutionary change in the European system, which has hitherto operated as if each member state has total freedom to nominate its “own” Commissioner(s), and even to lobby for their portfolios.
<P>
So the paradox is that the resignation of the outgoing Commission has had political consequences which are the opposite of those assumed by conventional wisdom.
<P>
Everyone can see that the European Parliament emerged much stronger than before, even if its new strength is not defined in Treaty terms.
Yet the Commission, or at least the Commission President, will also emerge more powerful than before.
But if we are witnessing an increase in the power both of the Parliament and of the Commission President, where has that power come from?
If these are the winners, who are the losers?
<P>
There is only one answer: the losers, in this crisis, can only be the member states; either directly; or indirectly, through the weakening of the independence of “their” national Commissioners.
<P>
This power shift will be most obvious in the case of the Commission President.
Although the Berlin summit’s final communique is imprecise, it seems that Romano Prodi will have an effective veto, not only over the nominations for the new Commission from 2000 onwards, but in deciding which members of the outgoing Commission will be permitted to soldier on as acting Commissioners for a few months more.
<P>
In other words, replacement of the 20 resigned Commissioners by a wholly new Commission approved by the Member States and endorsed by the European Parliament, could take several more months, and might not be complete until the second half of the year.
The question is, does this matter?
<P>
The answer is, No; provided Romano Prodi can bring to his European task a political project which is sufficiently inspiring and sufficiently realistic.
Apart from the unanimous nomination of Prodi, the main achievements of the Berlin summit were a dilution of the reform of farm policy, a dilution of budget reform, and maintenance of the absurd and hypocritical pretence that the first six candidates for membership can expect to be inside the EU by 2002.
<P>
What is clear, is that EU member states do not have an inspiring political project of their own in mind.
Their only explicit instruction to Prodi is that he should lay out a programme of administrative reform so as to avoid a re-run of the administrative scandals which brought down Santer.
In other words, if the European Union is to rediscover its way and its momentum, it will be up to Romano Prodi.
That is the measure of the power shift in the Union.

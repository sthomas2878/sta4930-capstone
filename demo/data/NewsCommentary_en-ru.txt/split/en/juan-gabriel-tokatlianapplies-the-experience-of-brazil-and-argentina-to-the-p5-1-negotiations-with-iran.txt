Latin America’s Lessons for Nuclear Diplomacy
<P>
BUENOS AIRES – In some ways, the latest negotiations on Iran’s nuclear program between it and the United Nations Security Council’s five permanent members plus Germany (the P5+1), which are set to resume in Geneva on November 7, seem to be more promising than previous rounds.
At the very least, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has pledged to take a more conciliatory approach than his predecessor.
<P>
But negotiators will have to navigate difficult circumstances, including economic uncertainty in the West and intense political turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa – not to mention a long history of mistrust and gridlock.
In order to maximize the chance of success, they should consider “best practices” from successful nuclear negotiations of the past, with the nuclear-cooperation agreement between Brazil and Argentina providing an example of “out-of-the-box” thinking on non-proliferation.
<P>
For many years, Brazil and Argentina were locked in a security dilemma.
Both were eager to be recognized as nuclear powers; indeed, there was active domestic support for proliferation in some circles in both governments.
With both countries on the verge of acquiring nuclear weapons, the rest of the world was understandably nervous.
From a military perspective, the situation could have escalated catastrophically.
<P>
But, since the mid-1980’s, the security threat has ebbed substantially.
While smart strategic leadership, democratic political systems, and economic interdependence undoubtedly contributed to this shift, the transition from nuclear competition to nuclear partnership – facilitated by shared values, common interests, and pragmatic understanding among key scientists, policymakers, and military actors – played a decisive role.
<P>
Argentines and Brazilians were never naïve about their aims and interests.
Rather, they were able to explore and define a bargaining scenario that offered mutually beneficial outcomes.
<P>
A credible and effective International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and a relatively balanced and influential United Nations Security Council aided their non-proliferation efforts substantially.
The end of the Cold War and domestic democratization were also essential, as they led to closer adherence to the rule of law and increased civilian control of the military.
<P>
A series of initiatives by Argentina and Brazil – such as the establishment of the Agency for Accounting and Control of Nuclear Materials (ABACC) in 1991 and both countries’ subsequent accession to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty – reinforced the demise of their military nuclear efforts.
The ABACC – the only agency of its kind recognized by the IAEA – played a particularly important role, because it legitimized intrusive bilateral inspections, reinforced the right to civilian nuclear development, generated mutual trust, won popular approval in both countries, and earned international esteem.
<P>
Today, Argentina and Brazil are developing a multi-purpose, non-military nuclear reactor together.
They are far more autonomous in terms of foreign policy than they were four decades ago, when they equated independence with nuclear capabilities.
Brazil has become a significant emerging power on the world stage, and Argentina has strengthened its civilian nuclear program and improved its external policies on that issue.
<P>
To be sure, reaching this point was not easy – but it was the only option.
During the 1960’s and 1970’s, the frequency of diplomatic stalemate forced the leaders of Argentina and Brazil to rethink international negotiations.
Their fundamental realization – that concrete deeds mean more than lofty intentions – shaped the talks between the two countries.
In this sense, the history of deadlock in nuclear talks with Iran could serve as a catalyst for progress.
<P>
The case of Argentina and Brazil suggests five important lessons for participants in the upcoming nuclear negotiations on Iran’s nuclear program.
<P>
Major nuclear powers can survive in a world where minor powers possess small nuclear arsenals.
It is the rest of the world – especially these countries’ neighbors – that suffers the consequences of a dysfunctional and illegitimate nuclear non-proliferation regime.
For everyone’s sake, participants in the upcoming talks on Iran’s nuclear program should apply the lessons gained in Argentina and Brazil.

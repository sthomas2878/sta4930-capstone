Is America Back?
<P>
HAMBURG: For most of President Clinton's watch the US was intent on staying out of international complications.
Mr. Clinton's favorite use of foreign policy was to promote US economic interests.
<P>
In the past year this pattern has undergone a sharp change.
Like a giant awakened, America shook off indifference and once again became involved around the globe.
<P>
In Europe where US reticence had blocked the Bosnia peace-plan negotiated by the Europeans, Washington fell in line, investing its power, and even its soldiers to secure the Dayton Accords.
US intervention defused a Turkish-Greek scuffle over two tiny Islands in the Aegean Sea that could have turned into a nasty conflict.
America vetoed the European candidate for Nato Secretary-General to put former Spanish foreign minister Solana in that job.
It took the lead in Nato's eastward enlargement strategy and in adjusting Nato's military structures.
<P>
In Asia, US aircraft carriers deterred threats from the China against Taiwan.
The Presidents also, through a new security agreement with Japan, served notice to the region that America would remain a major factor in the Pacific.
<P>
In the Middle East, US Secretary Christopher tried to advance the Arab-Israeli peace.
Since the Israeli elections gave victory to Netanjahue, US pressure on his government now remains the best hope for implementing the Oslo peace agreements between Israel and the Palestinians.
<P>
This list, not exhaustive, illustrates a dramatic shift in America's international behavior.
It is a change for which not only the traditional foreign policy establishment, but American opinion has shown appreciation.
The President, constrained by an opposition Congress and impending elections from making major domestic initiative, has discovered that America's international involvement pays off in increased respect abroad as well as increased popularity at home.
<P>
America would not be America if the shift did not also find its reflection in public debate.
The most significant has been offered by one of the chief intellectuals of the opposition Republicans, William Kristol.
Writing with colleague Robert Kagan in the July/August issue of the leading US foreign policy journal Foreign Affairs, Kristol not only welcomes the return to active US international involvement, he dismisses what has been done so far as based not on a strategic vision but merely on "a tepid consensus."
The vision that he and his co-author advocate is much more aggressive: America should aim for benevolent global hegemony.
<P>
Kristol and Kagan specifically advocate a "neo-Reaganite" foreign policy, calling for an increase by one quarter of America's still impressive defence budget.
But they want their country to be much more than a global cop - they want to promote American democracy and human rights world-wide, "pursuing policies - in Iran, Cuba, or China, for instance - intended ultimately to bring about a change of regime."
<P>
If implemented, such a policy would be resented by much of the world.
But given the choice between a United States aloof from the world and one that engages in benevolent hegemony, many countries will prefer the latter, hoping ideological would soon cool.
It is worth remembering that Americans have traditionally needed an ideological mission to become involved in the world.
Kristol's doctrine promises to satisfy this need for the new era of international affairs much better than Clinton's opportunistic pragmatism.
<P>
So do these ideas, and Clinton's new international activism, signal a true return to internationalism?
No.
Superpowers only come in pairs.
As long as the Soviet Union was a rival, America had to be a superpower -- protecting allies, intervening against hostile encroachments -- the leader of the West.
<P>
Now, the USSR has gone, and Russia's international influence is a shadow of what the Soviet Union's used to be.
But America's influence, too, has declined.
Allies no longer need protection.
Even the overwhelming military strength of the US only bears on those international situations which have the potential to turn into military conflicts; in all others -- the vast majority -- missiles and aircraft carriers retain little impact.
<P>
Superpower status requires a superpower mentality.
It requires ambition, purpose and thrust.
Only rivalry with another superpower can generate these.
<P>
That is why the list of recent US international activities does not add up to reliable international leadership, and why America can no longer assume the role of "benevolent hegemon."
Not one energizing danger lurks in the world.
There is merely a host of potential risks which, however, will often hit other countries before the US.
<P>
There will be times when America will engage its power and authority.
But this will be unpredictable and predictably often too late.
It will be determined primarily by domestic political considerations, and will be less likely when it demands spending American dollars or risking American lives.
It is one thing for America to request, for example, replacing Mr. Boutros-Ghali at the UN, it is a very different one to pay the billion dollars which the US still owes the world body.
<P>
America has lost its mission and with it much of its generosity.
That is scarcely surprising.
After all, the era of superpower rivalry and hence of superpowers is over.
It is back to normal, to domestic priorities, to a narrow definition of national interests.
If the US can resist this trend, America's friends have reason to rejoice.
But they have no reason to fool themselves that America is returning to the old role of leader.
And they have no alibi for sitting on their hands until America acts.

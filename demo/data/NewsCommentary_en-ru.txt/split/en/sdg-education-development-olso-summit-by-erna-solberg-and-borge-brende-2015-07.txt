No Education, No Development
<P>
OSLO – Education is a human right.
And, like other human rights, it cannot be taken for granted.
Across the world, 59 million children and 65 million adolescents are out of school.
More than 120 million children do not complete primary education.
<P>
Behind these figures there are children and youth being denied not only a right, but opportunities: a fair chance to get a decent job, to escape poverty, to support their families, and to develop their communities.
This year, decision-makers will set the priorities for global development for the next 15 years.
They should make sure to place education high on the list.
<P>
The deadline for the Millennium Development Goals is fast approaching.
We have a responsibility to make sure we fulfill the promise we made at the beginning of the millennium: to ensure that boys and girls everywhere complete a full course of primary schooling.
<P>
The challenge is daunting.
Many of those who remain out of school are the hardest to reach, as they live in countries that are held back by conflict, disaster, and epidemics.
And the last push is unlikely to be accompanied by the double-digit economic growth in some developing economies that makes it easier to expand opportunities.
<P>
Nevertheless, we can succeed.
Over the last 15 years, governments and their partners have shown that political will and concerted efforts can deliver tremendous results – including halving the number of children and adolescents who are out of school.
Moreover, most countries are closing in on gender parity at the primary level.
Now is the time to redouble our efforts to finish what we started.
<P>
But we must not stop with primary education.
In today’s knowledge-driven economies, access to quality education and the chances for development are two sides of the same coin.
That is why we must also set targets for secondary education, while improving quality and learning outcomes at all levels.
That is what the Sustainable Development Goal on education, which world leaders will adopt this year, aims to do.
<P>
Addressing the fact that an estimated 250 million children worldwide are not learning the basic skills they need to enter the labor market is more than a moral obligation.
It amounts to an investment in sustainable growth and prosperity.
For both countries and individuals, there is a direct and indisputable link between access to quality education and economic and social development.
<P>
Likewise, ensuring that girls are not kept at home when they reach puberty, but are allowed to complete education on the same footing as their male counterparts, is not just altruism; it is sound economics.
Communities and countries that succeed in achieving gender parity in education will reap substantial benefits relating to health, equality, and job creation.
<P>
All countries, regardless of their national wealth, stand to gain from more and better education.
According to a recent OECD report, providing every child with access to education and the skills needed to participate fully in society would boost GDP by an average 28% per year in lower-income countries and 16% per year in high-income countries for the next 80 years.
<P>
Today’s students need “twenty-first-century skills,” like critical thinking, problem solving, creativity, and digital literacy.
Learners of all ages need to become familiar with new technologies and cope with rapidly changing workplaces.
<P>
According to the International Labour Organization, an additional 280 million jobs will be needed by 2019.
It is vital for policymakers to ensure that the right frameworks and incentives are established so that those jobs can be created and filled.
Robust education systems – underpinned by qualified, professionally trained, motivated, and well-supported teachers – will be the cornerstone of this effort.
<P>
Governments should work with parent and teacher associations, as well as the private sector and civil-society organizations, to find the best and most constructive ways to improve the quality of education.
Innovation has to be harnessed, and new partnerships must be forged.
<P>
Of course, this will cost money.
According to UNESCO, in order to meet our basic education targets by 2030, we must close an external annual financing gap of about $22 billion.
But we have the resources necessary to deliver.
What is lacking is the political will to make the needed investments.
<P>
This is the challenge that inspired Norway to invite world leaders to Oslo for a Summit on Education for Development, where we can develop strategies for mobilizing political support for increasing financing for education.
For the first time in history, we are in the unique position to provide education opportunities for all, if only we pull together.
We cannot miss this critical opportunity.
<P>
To be sure, the responsibility for providing citizens with a quality education rests, first and foremost, with national governments.
Aid cannot replace domestic-resource mobilization.
But donor countries also have an important role to play, especially in supporting least-developed countries.
We must reverse the recent downward trend in development assistance for education, and leverage our assistance to attract investments from various other sources.
For our part, we are in the process of doubling Norway’s financial contribution to education for development in the period 2013-2017.
<P>
Together, we need to intensify efforts to bring the poorest and hardest to reach children into the education system.
Education is a right for everyone.
It is a right for girls, just as it is for boys.
It is a right for disabled children, just as it is for everyone else.
It is a right for the 37 million out-of-school children and youth in countries affected by crises and conflicts.
Education is a right regardless of where you are born and where you grow up.
It is time to ensure that the right is upheld.

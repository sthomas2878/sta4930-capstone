Overcoming Latin America’s Crime Crisis
<P>
Violent crime undermines societies in much the same way that it blights individual victims.
Indeed, many Latin American and Caribbean countries are caught in a vicious cycle: citizens have stopped trusting the criminal justice system because it cannot keep up with rising crime rates.
If Latin America’s economies and democracies are to flourish, faith in such key institutions must be restored.
<P>
The number of homicides committed with firearms in Latin America – between 73,000 and 90,000 a year – is triple the world average.
For people between 15 and 44, violence is the region’s leading killer.
Though crime rates differ widely between (and within) nations, the reported homicide rates for Colombia, El Salvador, Venezuela, and Brazil are among the world’s highest.
A recent United Nations-funded study estimated that violent crime costs El Salvador a whopping 11.5% of its GDP.
<P>
While we know that drugs and arms trafficking are major problems for some parts of Latin America, there’s no reliable information about their influence.
It is difficult to compare victimization rates between nations because police records are often poor – generated by corrupt politicians or police administrations to support their political view of how crime should be handled.
<P>
Too often, policy debates about law and order discussions are mired in partisan divisions.
Calls for more police and tougher prison sentences are seen as a right-wing effort to control the underclass, while prevention programs based on an enhanced standard of living are derided as “socialist.”
But if we remove these ideological blinders and focus on costs and benefits, we can identify the best ways of tackling crime and violence.
<P>
In our report for the Consulta de San Jose, we measured different strategies.
We found that policymakers should first embrace comprehensive programs targeting at-risk children.
This reflects growing evidence that behavior learned in childhood has significant consequences for an individual’s entire life.
<P>
Indeed, it is even possible to make a difference before a child is born.
Latin America and the Caribbean have a high rate of low-income, single-mother households.
Examples from around the world show that poor, single mothers who receive frequent visits from nurses before and after they give birth provide better prenatal care, have fewer subsequent pregnancies, and increase their educational attainment and workforce participation.
As a result, their children’s emotional and developmental well-being improve.
<P>
Likewise, offering early education to children in low-income families leads to higher secondary-school graduation rates, less youth delinquency, and lower rates of long-term offending.
<P>
We estimate that providing nurse visits and early childhood education would cost $2,650 per child over four years.
That seems a fairly steep price.
But think about how much crime costs its victims and society.
We calculate the benefits will come to $6,100 per child, partly owing to less future crime.
<P>
We also recommend that policymakers deal comprehensively with gang violence.
Conditions in Latin America are ripe for gang crime.
A “youth bulge” has created a significant group without jobs, decent education, or realistic expectations of legal employment – a large, disaffected, and socially disconnected recruiting pool for gangs.
<P>
Beating the gangs means more than just investing in the police, although often that will be required, too.
In successful crackdowns, police focus first on the tools of violence, cutting the flow of illegal handguns to youths.
Then they work alongside schools, social service agencies, and community groups to confront gang members directly.
Leaders and serious offenders can expect severe repercussions while other gang members are offered an “out” – job training and help accessing social services.
<P>
This approach is unlikely to work everywhere in Latin America.
In some areas, gang violence is so pervasive that nothing short of military-type action is likely to have an effect.
Tackling individual youth issues one-on-one might not only be too little too late, but also is unlikely to be effective in a “war zone.”
<P>
But it would work in some cities.
Evidence from the US indicates that an individualized program aimed at breaking gang ties would cost around $250 per person in Latin America, but could yield benefits worth $2,900.
<P>
Moreover, studies suggest that a comprehensive prison treatment and reintegration program would reduce recidivism.
This would involve drug treatment, educational and vocational programs, and behavioral therapy, costing $450 per adult offender.
The benefits would be between four and ten times higher.
<P>
Reducing crime across Latin America and the Caribbean won’t happen overnight.
There is no silver bullet or even a single right answer for policymakers in different countries.
<P>
But the damage caused by crime – to citizens and democratic institutions – require that we avoid letting ourselves get bogged down in political debate.
Youth prevention programs, cracking down on gangs, and recidivism reduction schemes would yield massive pay-offs compared to their costs, thus representing a sound investment in Latin America’s future.

Free the Regulators
<P>
Corporate accounting scandals - indeed, the economic history of the last decade - demonstrate that global financial markets need politically independent regulatory agencies.
The succession of financial crises that stained the 1990s had many and varied causes, but dysfunctional regulatory arrangements usually aggravated the effects.
Each crisis exposed weak and ineffective legal frameworks (often deliberately maintained by politicians), inadequate and dispersed supervision, and forbearance policies that only an industry lobbyist could love.
<P>
Until recently, the independence of financial regulators and supervisors received only marginal attention.
This is surprising, given that the case for central bank independence has been well established since the late 1980s.
Over the past 15 years, as many central banks became legally independent from government influence, the results in terms of lower price inflation have become undeniable.
Few now challenge the importance of central bank independence for achieving monetary stability.
<P>
Independence for financial sector regulators is as important as independence for central banks, and for many of the same reasons.
Just as an independent central bank helps the private sector take long-term decisions based on a clear and stable set of rules, so an independent financial sector regulator can ensure that the rules of the regulatory game are applied consistently over time.
If bankers know in advance that insolvent banks will be closed, and that lobbying to keep them open will not work, they will take fewer risks and the likelihood of their activities giving rise to a full-blown banking crisis will be reduced.
<P>
But when politicians become directly involved in regulation, ad hoc decisions often result, and powerful or well-connected bankers often discover that the rules, as if by magic, do not apply to them.
It was much the same story when politicians were directly involved in setting interest rates, with similarly disappointing results in terms of the consistency of decisions and the record in combating inflation.
Monetary and financial stability are two sides of the same coin and must reinforce each other, so their supervisory agencies need a similar degree of independence.
<P>
However, independence for regulatory agencies should not mean the absence of any democratic oversight whatsoever.
One reason that greater independence for regulators in general has been unpopular with politicians is the legitimate fear that independent state agencies could turn into an uncontrolled fourth branch of government.
<P>
This concern is especially strong in the case of financial regulators.
In every developed economy, the financial sector plays a central role, and its regulators wield power unmatched by most other supervisory agencies.
When intervening in financial institutions or revoking licenses, they are authorized to bring the coercive power of the state to bear against private citizens and capital.
To prevent abuse of these far-reaching powers, their exercise needs to be balanced by routine accountability.
<P>
These two attributes of supervisory agencies - political independence and political accountability - are often presented as zero-sum choices: more of one necessarily means less of the other.
But the opposite is true.
Independence boosts the effectiveness of market supervision only when accompanied by accountability.
Central banks increasingly realize that no matter how much legal independence they have, their credibility with investors requires transparent monetary policy and effective communication with politicians and the wider public.
<P>
Accountability entails a proper legal basis, clear objectives, well defined relationships between the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government, clear procedures for appointment and dismissal of chief executives, override mechanisms, budgetary accountability rules, and rules supporting transparency.
<P>
Even after the crises of the 1990s, institutional arrangements in many countries still fail to establish these conditions.
Moreover, the independence of bank supervision typically lags behind central bank independence, and the overall regulatory framework for other financial services, notably insurance, is often even weaker.
The trend in many countries towards unification of supervisory functions should be regarded as a golden opportunity to strengthen as well as to harmonize regulatory arrangements throughout their financial sectors.
<P>
The broader political environment, too, needs to be conducive to effective independence.
Often, the independence of central banks and regulatory agencies exists only on paper.
Vested political interests in the financial system remain strong in many parts of the world and the immediate political cost of overriding regulators is low.
<P>
To the extent that this remains the case, countries will treat financial stability as a secondary interest - just as they treated inflation when monetary policy was subject to direct government intervention.
In the long-term, financial stability, no less than price stability, requires independent and accountable regulators and supervisors.

Ending Genocide Denial at Srebrenica
<P>
CHICAGO – Driving into Srebrenica, where a brutal genocide was carried out 20 years ago, remains a surreal experience.
It lies deep within the time-warped landscape of Republika Srpska, the economically depressed Serb sector of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Streets evoke a ghost town.
The central square is barren, with none of the typical outdoor cafes teeming with locals and tourists common in other cities and towns in the more prosperous Federation, or non-Serb, region of the country.
<P>
Still standing on many of Srebrenica’s streets are the gutted homes of the Muslims who were routed out by Bosnian Serb forces led by General Ratko Mladić.
A few miles north of town is the former United Nations peacekeeping base of Potočari, where now rest the fractured remains of most of the more than 8,000 mainly Muslim men and boys slaughtered over several days in July 1995.
The cemetery is an impressive but haunting demonstration not only of the genocide itself; but also of the survivors’ determination that it be remembered.
<P>
The house that was used to rape Muslim women, while the men and boys were being led to their deaths, still stands next to the cemetery.
It is occupied by Serbs.
Every day, thousands of Bosnian Serbs living in the area walk or drive by the crumbling homes of the cleansed Muslims, the vast field of white Islamic grave stones, and the rape house, each one boldly reminding them of the undeniable.
<P>
Unfortunately, not everybody in Republika Srpska believes that the genocide at Srebrenica should be remembered.
The region’s president, Milorad Dodik, clings to power by spinning revisionist tales steeped in denial.
He disputes the number of Muslims killed in Srebrenica, conceding only that “a grave atrocity” happened.
Now, he wants to set up a “truth commission” stacked with Serb “experts” to reexamine the events of 1995.
<P>
This revisionism extends beyond Srebrenica.
Two years ago, when Dodik testified before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia as a defense witness in the trial of the Bosnian Serb president at the time of the massacre, he blamed the Bosnian war on the country’s Muslims.
<P>
Inspired by the Russian annexation of Crimea, Dodik is seeking a more definitive break from Bosnia for Republika Srpska, even though such a move would defy the Dayton Peace Agreement that ended the war.
The more he can distance his autonomous Serb republic from its victims, the easier he will find it to deny the atrocity crimes committed by Bosnian Serb forces during the war.
<P>
Fortunately, the facts and the law on Srebrenica – and so much more of the Bosnian conflict – have been established beyond any reasonable doubt.
In three major cases, the Yugoslav Tribunal has convicted Bosnian Serb defendants – Radislav Krstić, Zdravko Tolimir, Vujadin Popović, and Ljubiša Beara – for the crime of genocide at Srebrenica, convictions that have been firmly upheld on appeal.
Mladić, who remains on trial, and Radovan Karadžić, whose verdict is expected in October, are being prosecuted for genocide and other crimes.
The International Court of Justice also confirmed in 2007 that genocide occurred in Srebrenica and held that Serbia had failed in its legal duty to prevent it.
<P>
The great value of international criminal tribunals and internationally-created hybrid tribunals is that they create a clear public record of events that are almost by definition murky and contested.
Through the rigorous investigation and prosecution of atrocity crimes (including genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes), these courts provide clear rebuttals to attempts at denial or revisionism by politicians and extremists.
Judge Carmel Agius, Vice-President of the Yugoslav Tribunal, said recently of the Popović trial, over which he presided, “I have no doubt that after the judgment of the Appeals Chamber, any attempt at denying that the Srebrenica genocide ever took place can only be considered as a deliberate distortion of the truth.”
<P>
The UN Security Council is considering a resolution advanced by the British government that condemns any denial of the genocide at Srebrenica or any other proven atrocity crimes in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
It describes such denial as “hampering efforts at reconciliation” in the country.
And indeed, victim groups I have spoken with cannot imagine reconciling with the Bosnian Serbs as long as they are attempting to rewrite history.
<P>
Last year, the Security Council unanimously adopted a similar resolution shaped by the jurisprudence of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda that condemned “without reservation” any denial of the Rwandan genocide of 1994.
It is up to the members of the Security Council – including Russia, which retains close ties to the Serbs – to decide whether our recollection of the events at Srebrenica will be shaped by deniers and revisionists or facts as recorded by international jurists.
<P>
My hope is that one day a vibrant outdoor café will sit beside a renovated Muslim-owned building in Srebrenica, where people of diverse heritage speak knowingly of the past and optimistically of their common future.
But before that happens, attempts to deny the genocide that happened there must be buried.

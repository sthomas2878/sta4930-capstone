A European Disease
<P>
CHICAGO: Many intellectuals in the United States and Eastern Europe believe that West European social welfare policies should be a blueprint for action in their own countries.
But those policies are financed by high taxes and costly mandates on business that are mainly responsible for the enormous increase in European unemployment during the past decade and a half.
This "European disease" cannot be cured until members of the European Union recognize it as potentially fatal.
<P>
In the late 1970s, unemployment was under 5 percent in France, Germany, and most other Western European nations.
It is now closer to 12 percent in France and Germany, and perhaps 20 percent in Spain.
The average rate for those under age 25 exceeds 25 percent in most members of the European Union.
By contrast, unemployment in the United States has not increased during the past fifteen years, presently is only 5.5 percent, and is only about 12 percent for young workers.
<P>
The United States’ experience shows that the growth in European unemployment is not due simply to greater competition from the less developed world or to other forces that affected all advanced countries equally.
The rapid growth of labor costs throughout Europe appears to have been a principle cause of its explosion in unemployment.
<P>
More than one-third of Germany’s and France’s average labor costs results from social security, health, unemployment compensation, disability, and other taxes; other European nations have similar shares.
Regulations that restrict layoffs and mandate numerous vacation days and other paid leaves raise Europe’s cost of labor far above the excessive level due to their heavy taxes.
Generous leaves for sickness and other reasons had increased Sweden’s and Germany’s absenteeism rates to almost 10 percent, compared with 2 percent to 3 percent in Japan and the United States.
<P>
To reduce costs, many European companies increasingly resort to temporary workers, because they are easy to dismiss and do not qualify for fringe benefits and taxes.
In Spain, where it is almost impossible to fire workers on the regular payroll, about one-third of employees are temporary.
Even in France and Germany, perhaps 10 percent or more of workers are temps.
<P>
Europe’s underground economy has grown rapidly, in part because it provides a way to escape government-imposed employee costs.
Although no reliable figures on this sector exist, crude estimates suggest perhaps 25 percent of all Italian and Spanish workers work underground at least part of the time as do 10 percent of those in Belgium, France, Germany, and Sweden.
<P>
When labor is expensive and firing employees is difficult, companies are reluctant either to replace departing workers or to expand employment when the economy picks up.
This is why it now takes much longer than a decade ago to find a job in Europe if you are a young job seeker, a mother returning to work after childbirth, or an immigrant.
Those out of work for over a year have grown to more than one-third of the unemployed.
<P>
For the same reasons, private employment in the European Union has barely increased during the past two decades: The public sector has accounted for almost all the growth in employment.
By contrast, Japan and the United States private employment has surged, while government employment has grown little.
<P>
The long-term unemployed, youths who never had a steady job, temporary employees, and underground workers, have little opportunity to invest in job skills and training.
The sharp growth in these categories means that fewer workers are being trained in European economies.
This inadequate training makes it still harder for workers to find satisfactory long-term jobs since modern economies demand high levels of skill and knowledge.
<P>
Teenagers, high school dropouts, and immigrants frequently find employment in small establishments, especially in fast-food chains and other retail sectors.
Increasing the minimum wage puts some of them out of work since their productivity is too low to justify the cost to employers.
<P>
Recent studies of minimum wages in the United States claim no negative effects on employment, and perhaps even positive effects, but these studies have been shown to be based on deeply flawed evidence.
A reanalysis of their evidence, as well as other evidence, continues to show sizable reductions in employment of teenagers and others with limited skills when minimum wages increase significantly.
<P>
Yet some Europeans governments, in misguided attempts to raise incomes and spending, have foolishly increased their minimum wages - the conservative French government this past summer raised the minimum to over $7 per hour.
Even those American economists who believe that a slightly higher minimum for the United States - it is presently $4.25 per hour - would not have much effect on employment probably agree that a $7 per hour minimum would have large effects on the opportunities of teenagers and others with few skills.
<P>
Sometimes the need for a higher rate of pay is justified by noting that a family cannot live decently on minimum wage earnings.
However, raising the minimum is not an effective way to reduce poverty since poor families typically get only a small fraction of their income from members whose wages are near the minimum.
<P>
The French government is also subsidizing the employment in both the private and public sectors of hundreds of thousands of mainly young unqualified workers.
However, most of these expensive and inefficient subsidies would be unnecessary if the minimum wage were much lower, and if French labor markets were much freer.
<P>
Government regulations and transfer payments, not company needs, also explain the sharp fall in European labor-force participation rates of men aged 60 to 65 - from about 80 percent in the 1960s to under 50 percent in many European countries now.
Realization of eligibility requirements for disability pay and generous Social Security benefits induced many older workers to take early retirement.
Why keep working if you can get almost as much income by retiring and collecting pensions from the French, German, or other governments?
<P>
It is paradoxical that although older persons are much healthier and living considerably longer than they did fifty years ago, government policies have driven most of them out of work into retirement.
Since many of the elderly have much to contribute to the economy through their experience and judgment, their choice between work and retirement should not be skewed and biased by government mandates and financial incentives.
<P>
Taxes and death may be inevitable, but not the degree of taxation and regulation prevailing in France and other European nations.
A large dent will not be made in the disgracefully high unemployment and low employment until European social policies are recognized for what they are: A serious disease that badly infects their labor markets.

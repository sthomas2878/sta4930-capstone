The End of the Trump Administration?
<P>
MEXICO CITY – The world’s view of US President Donald Trump’s administration is changing for the worse.
In fact, the chaos and controversy that have marked Trump’s short time in office have deepened doubts, both inside and outside the United States, about whether his presidency will even survive its entire four-year term.
<P>
Europe’s perspective was articulated most clearly by German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
After a contentious NATO summit and a discordant G7 meeting, she concluded that the US, under Trump, can no longer be viewed as a reliable partner.
“The times in which we could rely fully on others,” she stated pointedly, “are somewhat over.”
<P>
Merkel’s statements were driven partly by disagreement between Trump and Europe on climate change, trade, NATO (particularly Article 5, its collective defense clause, which Trump refused to endorse), and relations with Russia.
But disagreement on such issues reflects divisions within Trump’s own administration, raising questions about who, if anybody, is actually in charge.
<P>
Consider Trump’s decision to withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement.
The move was advocated by Trump’s chief strategist, Steve Bannon, and his speechwriter, Stephen Miller.
But Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, as well as Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner – both of whom are official White House advisers – also may not have supported withdrawal from the accord, despite Tillerson’s public defense of his boss’s decision.
<P>
Trade is another internally disputed issue.
Bannon opposes the existing order of global openness, as does Peter Navarro, who heads the White House National Trade Council.
Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross supports open trade, but not without reservation.
Similarly, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer would prefer bare-knuckle negotiations to disruption, though he is already in a spat with Ross.
<P>
On NATO and Russia, Tillerson has echoed Trump in pressuring the Alliance’s European members to increase their defense spending.
But he has also taken a harder line on Russia than Trump, calling for a strong and united approach by the US and Europe.
While National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster agrees with Tillerson in theory, turf battles between the two posts’ occupants – a time-honored tradition – have already begun.
<P>
Such infighting has raised concerns far beyond Europe.
As one Latin American foreign minister told me recently, “Apparently everybody is fighting with everybody over everything.”
Add to that the investigation into the Trump campaign’s relationship with Russia, as well as the administration’s plummeting approval ratings, and it is easy to understand why some are doubting whether they should bother to engage with Trump at all.
Mexico’s President Enrique Peña Nieto has postponed meeting with Trump indefinitely, and other countries, too, are placing ties with the US on hold.
<P>
With a premature end to Trump’s presidency becoming less farfetched by the day, it is worth asking how it could come about.
There are three possibilities.
<P>
The first and best-known route is impeachment: a majority in the House of Representatives would indict Trump for “high crimes and misdemeanors,” and a two-thirds majority in the Senate would convict him, removing him from power.
Such an outcome – which would require the support of 20 Republican representatives and 18 Republican senators, plus all Democrats in both houses – remains highly unlikely.
But everything could change if the investigation into Russia’s attempts to influence the 2016 election and the possibility of collusion with Trump’s campaign reveals a smoking gun.
<P>
The second option, per Section 4 of the 25th Amendment to the Constitution, would require the vice president and the cabinet or Congress to declare the president “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.”
This seems even more unlikely than impeachment, unless some of Trump’s behavior – like his middle-of-the-night tweets or private rants against his aides (most recently, Attorney General Jeff Sessions) – clearly indicates neurological dysfunction or psychopathology.
<P>
The third option, which some have called the “Nixonian solution,” is the most intriguing.
In 1974, President Richard Nixon resigned before Congress could vote to impeach him.
Weeks later, Nixon’s successor Gerald Ford granted him a full and unconditional pardon for all possible crimes.
<P>
In Trump’s case, such a resignation could be spurred by the desire for a similar pardon.
While Trump cannot be indicted on criminal charges while president, he can be prosecuted for illegal behavior after he leaves office.
<P>
Moreover, both Kushner, who has been accused of attempting to set up a back channel for secure communication between the White House and the Kremlin, and Ivanka would be subject to prosecution if they were found to have engaged in illegal communications or activities with Russian agents or officials.
Trump’s two eldest sons, who run his business empire, may also be liable for misdeeds.
If this threat becomes salient, Trump may prefer to resign and secure a pardon for all involved, rather than endure an impeachment process that may well end with him losing the presidency anyway.
<P>
But while Trump’s opponents might like to remove him from power, any of these scenarios could be highly damaging to the US and the rest of the world.
American participation, if not leadership, is indispensable to international cooperation in areas like global trade, climate action, and responses to all manner of crises, whether natural, humanitarian, or nuclear.
Moreover, Trump’s isolationism doesn’t imply US irrelevance or passivity; a distracted or disrupted America could be much worse.
<P>
Given this, Trump’s domestic opponents should be careful what they wish for, and America’s allies should try to find a way to engage with his administration more effectively.
Like it or not, the world’s best option is to ensure that the next three and a half years are as successful – or at least as resistant to disaster – as possible.

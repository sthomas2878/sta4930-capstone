In Defense of Cyprus
<P>
BERLIN – Greece is said not to have one.
Cyprus does, but needs to change it.
Luxembourg’s is similar to Cyprus’s, but apparently it is just fine.
Malta’s, however, requires more thought.
I am, of course, referring to countries’ “business model,” which all sovereign states have lately been deemed to have.
Germany, for example, is supposedly an export country.
<P>
In addition to Cyprus’s close ties to Greece and Russia, rooted in their shared Orthodox tradition, it has an important historical connection to the United Kingdom, owing to the lasting cultural impact of British colonial rule from 1925 until 1960.
For example, English remains the language of education and the lingua franca in Cyprus, and key institutions were modeled on those in the UK.
<P>
Cyprus spends 7% of its GDP on education, the third-highest share in the European Union.
Many Cypriots attend universities in the UK or North America, with almost four of five students studying abroad.
And 47% of Cypriots have a university education, the highest level in the EU.
<P>
Such a well-educated and mobile population is essential to Cyprus’s business model, in which high-value accountancy, banking, and legal services compensate for the country’s lack of agriculture and heavy industry.
The free movement of payments, capital, and services associated with EU membership afforded Cyprus additional advantages.
Add low taxes and a double-taxation convention with Russia, and it is no surprise that Cyprus’s business model –serving as an international center for services and trade – has been successful.
<P>
Those who want to force Cyprus to abandon its model – condemning it to suffer for years with a debilitated economy and continual transfers from the EU – do not understand the country’s history and role.
More important, they do not recognize that Cyprus’s model has not failed.
Rather, Cyprus has fallen victim to flaws in Europe’s monetary system.
<P>
By creating a system that is heavily dependent on highly rated government bonds, which are deposited at the European Central Bank in exchange for liquidity, Europe has given banks – particularly larger institutions – no choice but to purchase such bonds.
By treating eurozone-government bonds as risk-free, permitting commercial banks to hold them without any capital provision, and failing to apply limits on large-scale credit exposure to sovereign debt, the system encouraged undercapitalized banks to increase their bond purchases.
<P>
Given that Cypriot banks were heavily exposed to Greek debt, they suffered massive losses from the haircut imposed on Greek government bonds in 2011.
In order to deposit the required new collateral at the ECB, the banks should have had to raise fresh capital, with those that failed to do so entering insolvency proceedings.
Instead, the Central Bank of Cyprus (CBC) provided emergency loans to commercial banks.
<P>
If the banks went bankrupt now, the CBC would have to record the total amount – estimated at up to €12 billion ($15.7 billion) – as a loss, delivering a potentially fatal blow to the eurozone’s credibility.
After all, the ECB has stood by for more than two years, never making a move to stop the CBC from providing such emergency loans – just as it has held back from intervening in any other eurozone country whose central bank was providing emergency loans.
Up to €89 billion in such loans is currently outstanding.
<P>
Scandalously, the CBC’s emergency loans will receive special treatment in the debt restructuring process.
While deposits above €100,000 at Laiki Bank – Cyprus’s second-largest bank, which will be wound down – will be used for recapitalization, the CBC, Cyprus’s largest creditor, is getting off scot-free.
Its claim, amounting to €9 billion, will be transferred to the Bank of Cyprus, the country’s largest bank, to be repaid in full.
In other words, Europe’s central-banking system, composed of the ECB and national central banks, is saving itself, and Cypriot savers and European taxpayers are footing the bill.
<P>
It is Europe’s banking system, not Cyprus’s business model, that is most in need of reform.
Europe’s crisis is rooted in the state monopoly over the issue and circulation of money, and in flawed management of the financial system.
<P>
But, instead of addressing these defects, the EU is moving toward a banking union, in which member countries’ credit risks are pooled via a single deposit-insurance system, supervisory mechanism, and bank-resolution mechanism.
The result will be a more uniform – and more fragile – banking system.
<P>
Europe does not need harmonization and centralization; it needs consistent decentralization.
Commercial banks must be liable for the risks that they take, and the use of taxpayers’ money in winding down banks must be categorically ruled out.
Only then will the insolvency regime be genuinely subject to market forces.
Furthermore, government bonds should no longer be treated as riskless, and they should be subject to the limits for large-scale credit exposure.
<P>
These are the absolute minimum steps that must be taken to contain Europe’s credit crisis.
But the decisive step would be to take money creation out of the state’s hands entirely, and open it up to competition.
Europe is experiencing a crisis of the fiat monetary system, which can only be overcome with competing private currencies.

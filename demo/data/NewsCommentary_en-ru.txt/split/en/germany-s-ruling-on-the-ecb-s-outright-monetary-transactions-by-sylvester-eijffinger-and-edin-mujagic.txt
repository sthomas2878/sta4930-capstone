OMT’s German Trial
<P>
TILBURG – On June 12, the eyes of politicians, economists, analysts, and investors will alight briefly on the leafy German town of Karlsruhe, as the German Constitutional Court holds hearings on the legitimacy of the European Central Bank’s “outright monetary transactions.”
The OMT scheme permits the ECB to purchase weaker eurozone countries’ government bonds, on the condition that these countries’ authorities implement European Financial Stability Facility/European Stability Mechanism (EFSF/ESM) programs.
The court’s ruling is expected by the end of the summer.
<P>
Anti-euro groups, which have been proliferating across Europe, hope that the court will decide that the OMT program violates either the European Union treaties, the ECB’s statute, or Germany’s constitution.
But, while OMT may well turn out to be a mistake, the court does not actually have the constitutional authority to forbid the ECB from pursuing it.
<P>
Given that judicial decisions are ex post, not ex ante, the court cannot prevent OMT before it is activated.
The ECB has stated that it would initiate OMT when needed, and under strict conditions.
While the ECB – like most other EU institutions – has a poor track record on adhering to rules, even its own, the assumption that OMT will be no different is insufficient to justify a ruling against it.
<P>
As it stands, the judges in Karlsruhe can assess only the established procedure governing how and when OMT would be activated.
As long as OMT is perceived to be compatible with EU treaties and with the German constitution, which seems likely, the judges will not block the program.
<P>
One could argue that OMT would be used as a part of the ECB’s monetary policy, and not to finance budget deficits in some member states, which the ECB’s statute does not permit.
While that claim is dubious under current circumstances, it can be refuted only in practice, and can be assessed only after the program has been activated for at least a year.
<P>
Moreover, contrary to popular perception, the German Constitutional Court’s record is pro-EU and pro-euro.
In every case related to European Monetary Union that the court has heard so far – from its October 1992 ruling on the Maastricht Treaty to its most recent, issued last September – Europe has won the day.
<P>
Even when the court had serious reservations – for example, about eurozone membership for Italy and Belgium, where public debt was almost double the Maastricht-dictated maximum of 60% of GDP (Greece had already been excluded from the monetary union’s initial roster) – it ruled in Europe’s favor.
Indeed, it ruled that German participation in the single currency was consistent with Germany’s constitution – as was the Lisbon Treaty, the EFSF, the ESM, the ECB’s breach of the EU’s no-bailout clause, and German guarantees for other eurozone countries’ debts.
<P>
To be sure, the court has not yielded to Europe entirely; it has almost always formulated additional demands.
But none of its rulings has endangered European integration.
Although it could easily have ruled that a treaty or emergency fund was unconstitutional unless further measures were taken, essentially sending its architects back to the drawing table, the court always opted for the more accommodating “yes, but” approach.
<P>
Nevertheless, one important feature of the OMT case distinguishes it from its predecessors: the Bundesbank is firmly opposed to OMT, claiming that it does not fall within the ECB’s mandate.
From the Bundesbank’s perspective, OMT’s potential to prevent a country from exiting the euro does not make it legal.
It has sent a 29-page brief to the court stating its position, and will argue its case before the court in June.
The ECB has countered with an even longer brief defending the program.
<P>
Although the ruling is formally on OMT’s legality, the implicit verdict on the Bundesbank’s true influence will be at least as important.
Given how difficult it would be for the court to rule against OMT at this point, the case may prove to be a massive blow to the Bundesbank’s credibility in Europe.

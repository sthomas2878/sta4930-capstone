Competing with Hollywood
<P>
LONDON: Just over one hundred years ago, one of the nineteenth century's greatest novelists said: "It was wonderful to find America, but it would have been more wonderful to miss it."
So wrote Mark Twain - a man whose work is almost synonymous with America itself.
<P>
When Twain wrote those words it must have seemed possible to live life unaffected by America.
Movies, jazz, advertising - all the modern American icons had yet to be born.
Today, American culture feels all-pervasive.
"Globalization" of our societies, development of the internet, the spread of liberal economics; all shrink boundaries to a point where it is impossible to avoid the American way of life, however devoutly some might wish to do so.
<P>
Given the seemingly ubiquitous nature of American culture, how should we respond?
There seem to be two ingrained ways of contemplating the spread of American influence.
The first sees American culture solely as a threat, with thousands of years of European history about to be swept away by a flood of crass images, cheap soundbites and mental junk food.
<P>
No country feels more threatened than France, where one intemperate intellectual went so far as to describe EuroDisney as a "cultural Chernobyl... a construction of hardened chewing gum and idiotic folklore taken straight out of comic books written for obese Americans."
Less stridently, such fears also manifest themselves from time to time in Germany, the UK and just about every other country in Western Europe -and, for different reasons, in Eastern Europe too.
<P>
At the other end of the scale are those who see the Americanization of the world as unequivocally good.
Or, as that well-known naturalized American, Rupert Murdoch puts it: "The modernization of the world necessarily means its Americanization."
<P>
Both of these poles seem to me entirely beside the point.
We stand on the threshold of a new information society, one which will overwhelmingly be driven by information and images.
Both US Vice President Al Gore and European Commissioner Martin Bangemann have compared the Information Society to the Industrial Revolution.
As Bangemann has put it, the "Information Society" is about nothing less than new ways of "living and working together".
<P>
Certainly, the development and use of information and communications technology is already blurring some familiar and apparently clear-cut oppositions: between information, education and entertainment.
The US appears to already have something of a lock on that triad - or certainly on its 'bookends', information and entertainment.
In my own industry, the imbalance of payments on filmed entertainment alone, between Europe and the US, is around $7 billion a year.
At present rates of growth, that will undoubtedly cross the $10 billion mark shortly after the millennium.
<P>
Surely, at some point those numbers become unsustainable.
We cannot develop a vigorous European economy, create European jobs and grow a European future while continually accommodating an increasing trade imbalance.
I have always believed that the underlying purpose of Free Trade is not to institutionalize imbalance, cultural or otherwise.
But institutionalizing it is precisely what we appear to be doing.
<P>
What makes that even more puzzling is that we in Europe, both east and west, possess a vast reservoir of creative talent, which we should be using to intelligently exploit the fantastic opportunities this Information Revolution offers us.
<P>
Make no mistake, the opportunities for creating and using images to tell stories and to deliver information will grow exponentially over the next couple of decades.
Hollywood understands this too - that's why, over the entire century of cinema they've eagerly snapped up the very best of our directors from Murnau to Lubitsch, Wyler, Wilder to Forman, de Bont and Verhoeven.
But filmmakers are just the tip of the iceberg - we know that in Europe we retain many of the assets which would, and should, enable us to mount a real challenge to America in the struggle for control of the information society - if only we had the energy, the confidence, and organization to do so.
<P>
It's not too late to create a programming, software and information-based industry capable of competing at the leading edge of what may well turn out to be the 21st Century's most exciting, profitable and influential, industrial and cultural sector.
But to do so, we have to stop treating culture in so neurotic and defensive a manner.
We must stop talking about 'protectionism', as if our culture were some sort of pathetic endangered species.
<P>
To begin, we must expand our whole notion of culture to embrace new areas - fashion, architecture, design, photography, even computer design - which have been largely excluded from serious European debate.
But we must also invest capital in our workforce, in building up companies seriously capable of challenging the titans of the American entertainment business, as well as companies like Microsoft and Netscape, who currently have such an iron grip on new and online media.
<P>
In 1989, in the heady days of perestroika, I addressed the Biannual Congress of Soviet Filmmakers in Moscow, suggesting they concentrate scarce resources on training - training a generation of filmmakers with confidence in their own culture, a confidence to go out and address the world's audiences.
Today, more than ever, I believe the challenges and opportunities of the multi-media world can only be addressed if we invest massively to create a trained and highly skilled workforce truly capable of taking on the world.
<P>
All this will require some genuinely new thinking, not least in countries where until relatively recently centralized state control of the arts was the norm.
We must allow the creative genius of our old and vastly experienced nations to move from their position of being funded and tolerated by the state to one where they have gained, at long last, their economic and cultural freedom.

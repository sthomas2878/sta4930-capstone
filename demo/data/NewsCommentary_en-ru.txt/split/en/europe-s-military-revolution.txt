Europe's Military Revolution
<P>
BRUSSELS: Creating the euro – a revolutionary innovation in an EU whose nature is to evolve slowly, by fits and starts – provoked debate across the continent and beyond.
Plans for a common EU defense policy, however, have thus far attracted less attention.
No longer.
Americans increasingly ask: “Why bother?” and point to the efficacy of NATO.
Europeans often find such questions hard to answer, partly because there is no single answer.
<P>
For believers in a more united Europe, closer cooperation on defense is self-evidently desirable.
Others emphasize the pragmatic, pointing out that EU members can achieve far more in foreign/defense policy by working together than on their own.
These pragmatists stress the growing number of external challenges – in the Balkans, Middle East, Africa or elsewhere – requiring a concerted response.
<P>
A third argument, held by some French Gaullists and many EU left-wingers, says that Europe needs a common foreign and defense policy to resist American hegemony.
This anti-American view, however, is not widely held.
Supporters of a common EU foreign/defense policy see a Europe capable of looking after its own defense as a better partner for the US.
<P>
Confusion and doubts arise now because of vagueness about the likely uses of the Rapid Reaction Force, a key step in developing these common policies.
The Rapid Reaction Force, it is said, should be capable of fulfilling the so-called “Petersberg” tasks.
Yet “peacemaking” (one of those tasks) could cover anything from Operation Alba – which in 1997 saw Italy lead a 6000-strong European force into Albania to suppress anarchy – to an attack on Sierra Leone rebels resisting UN peacekeepers, to Gulf War type conflicts.
Because all EU governments know that, for the foreseeable future, Europe will be capable of only modest military operations there is no great value in defining now how the Rapid Reaction Force will be used.
<P>
America should welcome the increasing weight and sense of responsibility for Europe as represented by the Rapid Reaction Force.
True, America’s role in NATO – that ingenious device through which America retains, with Europe’s blessing, an institutionalized influence over the continent – would diminish.
For NATO would become a framework in which two major powers, instead of one big and 18 smaller ones, coordinate policies and responses to crises.
The gains here outweigh any inconvenience to America’s freedom to maneuver.
<P>
Enhanced European capabilities would allow America to leave many instabilities in and around Europe in the care of its allies.
Moreover, adding defense to the informal acquis that would-be EU members must endorse will reduce pressure on NATO to enlarge.
An EU committed to its own defense, although not offering the same formal guarantees as NATO, offers candidate countries the prospect of belonging to a genuine security community.
<P>
More fundamentally, creation of a Europe whole and free, but also united, is America’s greatest foreign policy success of the past half-century.
To complete that objective, the EU must become a fully-fledged international actor.
<P>
Thus the challenges posed to America by Europe’s common and defense policy are primarily psychological.
In Europe, however, those challenges are matters of will and political leadership, which cannot come from committees.
Here we propose a number of institutional and policy reforms, including:
<P>
· Merging the jobs of Chris Patten, the external relations commissioner, and Javier Solana, the High Representative for foreign policy, so that the EU speaks with a single voice;
<P>
· Giving the new Brussels�based Political and Security Committee higher status to draw together both the inter�governmental and Community sides of foreign policy;
<P>
· Setting a Europe�wide target for national defense budgets, committing all member�states to spending at least 2% of GDP on defense, and 25% of their defense budgets on arms procurement and R&D
<P>
· Creating a special EU defense budget, to finance common missions, capabilities and weapons programs;
<P>
· Establishing a Monitoring Group of force planners, based within the Council of Ministers secretariat, to co�ordinate the peer group pressure that should encourage governments to improve their military capabilities.
<P>
Authority to build coalitions, push governments to fulfill deadlines, generate support or take the blame for failure must come from that traditional source of leadership, the nation state.
Because no single EU state can provide the dominant leadership America provided NATO during the Cold War, Britain, France, and Germany must assume this role in Europe.
Were one of them to oppose common action, the cohesion and credibility of any EU undertaking would be destroyed.
But if these three are determined to push ahead, they will represent the will of most, if not all, other EU members.
<P>
Membership in this group of three entails, not the power to command, but the responsibility to lead.
If these three fail to agree in a crisis, Europe will be opting out; if united on taking action, Europe will be committed.
So Britain, France, and Germany must start thinking of the EU as a whole, carrying the greatest burden and taking the greatest risks.
Their leadership will need to be informal, transparent, and inclusive.
Unfortunately, at this moment, none is prepared for these unenviable, yet inevitable, tasks.
But their commitment to Europe’s military revolution is bound to move them closer to fulfilling them.

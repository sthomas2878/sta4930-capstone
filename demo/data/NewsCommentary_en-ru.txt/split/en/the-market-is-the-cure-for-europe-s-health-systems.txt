The Market is the Cure for Europe’s Health Systems
<P>
Not even Germany’s great success in hosting the recently concluded World Cup competition could shield Angela Merkel’s government from the wrath of the German public for its disappointing healthcare reform proposals.
Such is the urgency of healthcare reform in Germany today that her government’s poll numbers dropped to new lows even as World Cup football boosted Germany’s image in the international community to new highs.
<P>
Of course, Germany is not the only country in the world facing healthcare costs that are unnecessarily escalating unnecessarily because of over-stimulated demand and inadequate competition on the supply side.
This is a problem in the United States as well as throughout Europe.
<P>
Various insurance schemes and government subsidies over-stimulate demand for medical services by making the price to consumers artificially low.
Because this prices understates the true cost of medical services to the economy, people buy more than the economy can afford to supply.
The result is too much pressure on healthcare resources, causing healthcare costs to escalate.
<P>
In Germany, the link between wages and healthcare costs exacerbates this problem is exacerbated by the link between wages and healthcare costs.
Because of the link, : the artificially low price of healthcare not only increases healthcare costs, but also —it escalatesdrives up wages as well.
The resulting decline in competitiveness puts an excess burden on the economy, making it even less able to absorb the over-stimulated demand for medical services without an increase in costs.
Supply-side inefficiencies due to a lack of competition make the problem even worse.
<P>
The failure of Merkel’s reform package to break the link between health costs and wages is a key reason why it has been widely criticized by economists.
<P>
Saying “no” to the market mechanism also has meant the disenfranchisement of the consumer of in several European countries.
<P>
The balance of power between the healthcare professionals – —doctors, hospital administrators, and government bureaucrats – -- on the one hand, and the patients on the other, has turned dramatically against the latter, particularly in countries where competition in health services is limited.
It’s as if the system is saying to Europe’s sick: “ bBeggars can’t be choosers.
You’re getting medical help on the cheap.
Don’t complain!”
<P>
The refusal to use market mechanisms has a lot to do with this imbalance.
When pricemarket prices isare not permitted allowed to determine the allocattion ofe scarce resources, waiting lists substitute.
What can the sick do when faced with a long waiting list for treatment?
<P>
There can be competition even in a socialized system if it allows private medicine.
The sick can beat the waiting list by buying treatment in the private sector.
But if antagonism against the market mechanism is sufficiently strong, private medicine may be prohibited or severely restricted (as it was in pre-reform Sweden before it reformed and as it is today in the Netherlands).
ThenIn that case, the only recourse for the sick may be to flee to another country for treatment.
<P>
Canadians often seek medical help in the US for this reason.
The Dutch often go to France or Switzerland.
It’s not that medicine is necessarily better in the US than in Canada (or in France and Switzerland than in the Netherlands.)
It’s that one country relies more on the market mechanism to allocate medical services than the other.
<P>
With healthcare problems so prevalent, why, then, is healthcare reform so difficult?
After all, no one is advocating a return to unfettered free-market capitalism for healthcare, with all its serious distributional inequities.
The answer lies in power politics and vested interests.
<P>
When Europeans were offered healthcare on the cheap, they grabbed for it, not realizing that they were buying into a system of ever escalating healthcare costs and eventual disenfranchisement.
Now, with subsidized and socialized healthcare entrenched, there is the overwhelmingpolitically political difficultyty in of introducing market-based reforms has become overwhelming, even when their efficiency gains are obvious.
The doctors, administrators, and bureaucrats are reluctant to relinquish control.
<P>
When Dutch doctors, for example, were asked whether they wanted private medicine, the majority said no, even though they could earn more money in a private system.
They preferred control (which is not taxed) to income (which is taxed and at high rates).
<P>
AlsoMoreover, the European public itself has become a formidable obstacle to reform, because it has developed a vested interest in cheap prices for medical services.
EuropeansThey don’t want any reform that raises the prices to themthey must pay.
Indeed, a major reason the public has turned against the Merkel reform package is that its main element is an increase in user charges.
<P>
The prognosis for healthcare reform in Europe (and in North America, for that matter) is not good.
It will take courageous politicians to overcome the entrenched vested interests that have we now seebuilt up in the caring for of the sick and elderlyhealthcare systems in democratic societies in much of the world—.
Unfortunately, and political courage is a scarce commodity these days.

Will Tony Blair Opt For Europe?
<P>
LONDON: In the closing days of the British election, the country's leading business paper, The Financial Times, came out against John Major's Conservative government and in support of Tony Blair's "New Labour" party.
It summed up its reasons in a phrase: "Europe is the issue".
<P>
It pointed out that under the Conservatives relations between Britain and the European Union (EU) had deteriorated sharply.
The Conservatives had drifted so far into an anti-Europeanposture that it was impossible to believe that they could make rational policy towards the EU.
That left only one option: to vote for Blair and New Labour.
<P>
What is strange here is that there are no obvious grounds for confidence that Labour will follow a policy significantly more pro-European than the Conservatives.
On the contrary, throughout the election campaign Tony Blair mimicked the anti-European rhetoric of the Conservatives, so as to avoid damaging accusations that he was preparing to "sell out" to Brussels.
On the key question of the single european currency (emu), he refused to commit himself on whether, when, or in what circumstances he would join.
His policy, like John Major's, is one of "Wait-and-See".
<P>
The problem with this dilatory posture, is that it is not suited to the EU agenda, or even to the facts of life.
By mid-June, governments are due to wrap up negotiations in the Inter- Governmental Conference (IGC), on the far-reaching political reforms required to make it feasible to enlarge the Union into Eastern Europe.
Six months later, they will start the enlargement process itself, by launching negotiations with candidate countries.
And a year from now, they will launch the final phase of economic and monetary union and the single currency.
<P>
This timetable exposes the futility of the Wait-and-See policy, and will force Britain to confront the more radical choice between the familiar rhetoric of Euro-skeptic resistance to Europe, or a new commitment to Europe.
In other words, Britain's relations with Europe will reach a crisis point.
<P>
Negotiations in the IGC on the reform of the EU have been bogged down by the obstructionism of the Conservative government; in opposition, Labour was almost as negative as Major's government.
These negotiations are now approaching the moment of truth.
Three weeks after taking office, Mr Blair will join the EU's leaders at an informal summit at Maastricht.
The official purpose of the meeting is to give a final push for the negotiations, bringing them to a mid-June conclusion.
The unofficial but real purpose, is to see whether it is possible to close the abyss between Britain and the rest.
It will be a test for Blair.
<P>
But the critical issue will be the single currency.
Labour's policy is ostensibly one of uncommitted but open-minded doubt.
The problem is that this kind of doubt cannot be resolved by any process of reason, at least not within the life of the new parliament.
<P>
Its implication is that new facts can be expected to come along which will make it possible to reach a conclusion one way or another.
But everything important about emu is already widely known; no really significant new facts, certainly no conclusive facts, will be known for a long time to come.
<P>
The essence of emu can be described in three propositions:
<P>
1.
Technically, emu is a bold experiment -- difficult, uncertain, without precedent, and so very risky.
<P>
2.
Emu is heavy with political implications, both for the individual nations and for the Union.
<P>
3.
Emu can only be explained, and only makes sense, through a combination of these two characteristics.
<P>
If we think of emu as a purely technical innovation, like an advanced and novel piece of sophisticated machinery never tried before, and then ask the question: Is It Likely To Work?, we are almost bound to give a skeptical answer.
But if we think of emu as a political as well as a technical undertaking, to which most member states are committed, and ask: Can They Make It Work?, we may get a different answer.
Of course, the answer might be No in both cases; but chances for a Yes are much higher in the second case than in the first.
<P>
So Labour's ostensibly reasonable posture of technical skepticism, is really a pseudo-rationalist pretext for staying out of emu but without saying so out loud.
<P>
If the pseudo-rationalist wants new information which could settle all doubts, he or she will have to wait for many years.
For nothing will happen in the next five years, before the completion of the single currency in 2002, which could help make up the mind.
And if he thinks a clear and decisive answer to the question Will It Work? is needed before a decision can be made, the wait may last until well into the next century, perhaps as late as the year 2010.
For the opening years of emu are likely to witness stress, turbulence and anxiety as the new system beds down.
That means waiting, not just until the next British election, but probably until the election after that.
<P>
A skeptical Britain might eventually conclude that EMU does indeed work, and then ask to be allowed to take part.
By then, however, the new political core on the continent will have consolidated, and will be less interested in making concessions to England.
<P>
So if Tony Blair wants to have the choice of joining the emu within any useful time-frame, he will have to abandon the pseudo-rationalist policy of Wait-and-See, and switch to a policy of commitment to emu as a political objective.
And he will probably have to make the switch before the end of this year, since the European hard core will start to form with the formal launch of the emu next spring.

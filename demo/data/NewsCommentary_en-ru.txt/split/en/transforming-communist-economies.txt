Transforming Communist Economies
<P>
CHICAGO: The very different paths taken toward market economies by the ex-communist nations provides a remarkable laboratory on how to transform centrally planned economies.
The evidence from these experiments speaks loud and clear that it is best to introduce large reforms rapidly without waiting to discover the "right" sequence of reforms.
Moving quickly allows the transformation to be guided mainly by the spontaneity of innovative market forces rather than by government planners or economists.
<P>
Yet many economists have advocated a slow and systematic pace because they believe the ordering of reforms toward a market economy makes an enormous difference to the long run success of the process.
However, historical experience offers little guidance on what the sequence should be because the scale of the transformations required by the collapse of communism is unprecedented.
Nor does economic theory provide a blueprint for change because markets have their own creativity and dynamics that are usually impossible to predict in advance.
<P>
In a recent book of essays Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus of the Czech Republic -- who has led the highly successful transformation of that nation -- draws on his experience when he emphasizes that the transformation process should be done quickly with a "mixture of intentions and spontaneity".
More than two hundred years ago, Adam Smith in his Theory of Moral Sentiments argued along similar lines that important public policy changes cannot be planned the way a master chess player moves pieces around on a chess board.
<P>
Rapid introduction of major reforms also prevents the various interest groups who benefited from communism from organizing effectively to slow and try to derail the transformation to a market economy.
Since these groups were thrown on the defensive for a while after the old regimes were toppled, initially they did not have the political power to oppose rapid and irreversible changes.
But they recovered their political voice -- in fact, most of the current leaders of the ex-communist countries are themselves former communists -- and they are advocating a slowdown in the pace of change that appeals to the elderly and others hurt by the transformation process.
<P>
Telling evidence to the advantages of speed comes from the different approaches taken to privatizing the thousands of enterprises initially in state hands.
Hungary, Poland, Romania, and most other ex-communist nations have delayed privatizing medium and large enterprises until their government managers "restructured" employment, accounting practices, and the product mix.
<P>
Since getting companies "ready" takes time and runs into opposition from workers and management, government-directed privatizations have been slow and inefficient.
Although Poland moved quickly toward macro stability and free prices, still almost half of its large enterprises remain in government hands, unemployment is well over 10 percent, and only a few companies are traded on its stock exchange.
<P>
The Czech Republic was determined to move quickly before political opposition could organize, and to use the creative powers of market forces rather than government officials to restructure state enterprises.
Klaus and a small team of associates came up with the brilliant idea of selling vouchers at a nominal price to the general public that they could use to bid for shares in different companies.
In just three years the Czechs used vouchers to privatize over two thousand enterprises, and they have essentially completed this stage of the transformation process.
<P>
Despite a few scandals and assorted other problems, the Czechs succeeded beyond even the most optimistic expectations.
Many mutual funds and other financial intermediaries formed to buy vouchers, bid for shares, and thereby gain a voice in reorganizing and guiding the privatized enterprises.
A newly-created, active, and sophisticated stock market trades shares in hundreds of companies, not the few dozen traded on other exchanges in central Europe.
The Czech Republic has the lowest unemployment rate in Europe, even though most privatized companies have been "restructured" by their new owners.
<P>
Aware of the success of the Czech approach, the Russian Republic introduced in 1992 a slightly modified version of the Czech voucher plan.
It took only two years to privatize some fourteen thousand medium and large enterprises, so that by June 1994 more than 85 percent of Russiaâ€™s industrial labor force was working in the private sector.
Russia has not yet achieved macroeconomic stability or a stable currency, and has other serious problems, but it has managed to transform quickly and on the whole successfully from a state-owned economy to a system of private ownership.
<P>
Abundant evidence from the ex-communist countries indicated that it is mistake for government bureaucrats to try to fine-tune the transformation to market economies.
It is much better to rely on the spontaneous creativity of businessmen, workers and markets.

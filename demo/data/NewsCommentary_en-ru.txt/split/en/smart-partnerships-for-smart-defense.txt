Smart Partnerships for Smart Defense
<P>
WASHINGTON, DC – When NATO leaders gather in Chicago next week, they will have an historic opportunity to bring the Alliance’s relations with non-member states into alignment with twenty-first-century realities.
Given NATO’s current lack of strategic coherence, and disparities in its members’ military capabilities – which have been aggravated by budget cuts in the wake of the global financial crisis – cooperation with non-members is no longer a luxury; it is a necessity.
<P>
NATO’s experiences in Afghanistan and Libya make clear that the Alliance can no longer afford to go it alone.
In both cases, contributions from capable, non-member countries proved important; indeed, in Libya, they were vital to NATO’s success.
<P>
Given this, NATO must step up its cooperation with a broad range of global players, including the Gulf Cooperation Council, the European Union, and Russia, as well as rising powers such as China.
Moreover, it must engage those partners that are not currently on track to become members, but are willing and able to contribute to its missions.
Countries that fit this description include Austria, Finland, and Sweden, and, outside Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and South Korea.
<P>
These partners’ value cannot be overstated.
Consider Sweden, which participated more actively than many NATO members during the recent campaign in Libya, sending 122 personnel and eight Gripen aircraft, at a monthly cost of $22 million.
In Afghanistan, Sweden has maintained – and even gradually increased – its troop presence in the northern province of Mazar-e-Sharif, where, together with Finland, it leads a Provincial Reconstruction Team.
<P>
But partnership is a two-way street.
To be successful, NATO must also make it more attractive for capable non-member states to cooperate with and contribute to the Alliance and its missions.
<P>
Many of the existing partnership arrangements that NATO has at its disposal, particularly the Partnership for Peace, are obsolete.
The PfP, which served a clear purpose in the 1990’s as a route to membership for Central European countries, has lost much of its value today.
After all, it makes little sense to lump together a group of countries as diverse as Sweden and Azerbaijan under the same framework.
<P>
Cooperation with core partners must move beyond political dialogue to practical initiatives that focus on strengthening partners’ capability to conduct joint missions with NATO in the future.
<P>
So “Smart Defense,” which the Alliance defines as “pooling and sharing capabilities, setting priorities, and coordinating efforts better,” must also be a partnership issue.
Capable non-member states must be integrated into the Smart Defense framework, including participation in developing critical competences such as intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance and strategic airlift.
<P>
A “smart partnership” policy should thus begin with a certification process by which key non-member states can reach higher levels of interoperability with NATO.
The Alliance should also expand the scope and scale of its joint exercises, increasing partners’ involvement in the planning and command of joint operations and improving information-sharing during such missions.
<P>
Skeptics might argue that singling out capable partners for new forms of cooperation would risk making NATO members’ security dependent on non-members, or that it could alienate less capable partners, or give current NATO members a free ride.
If countries want to contribute to the Alliance, they should simply become members.
<P>
But improved cooperation with non-member states could spur others to follow suit, while encouraging members to commit greater resources to the Alliance.
Many of NATO’s key partners, such as Finland and Sweden, already qualify for membership, but have chosen to remain outside of the Alliance for domestic political reasons – a position that has not resulted in free riding by member states.
<P>
What NATO desperately needs is a more flexible, inclusive dialogue with key partners that share its values and are willing and able to contribute to its missions.
In this age of austerity, characterized by shrinking defense budgets on both sides of the Atlantic, a “smart partnership” policy that is designed to allow individual countries or groups of countries to improve their interoperability with NATO is the obvious way forward.
<P>
Indeed, if NATO is to remain a viable global security institution in the twenty-first century, the Alliance’s summit in Chicago should embrace new and innovative partnership initiatives.

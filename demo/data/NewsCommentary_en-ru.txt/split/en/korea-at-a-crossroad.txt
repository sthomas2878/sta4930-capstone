Korea At A Crossroad
<P>
SEOUL: South Korea is suffering the blues.
Its stock market is down as world markets rise.
Growth has slowed, the external balance widened, the currency is soft, a single North Korean U-boat shakes confidence, terms of trade are bad, and the chaebols (the country's industrial conglomerates) are investing offshore.
Policy choices, moreover, are confusing.
Should the government seek a strong currency to boost confidence in the capital account or should it accept a weak currency for a strong current account and growth?
Should it fight inflation or slump?
Should it see these issues as transitory, or a deep structural crisis?
<P>
Perversely, a country that thought blindly imitating Japan was the way to prosperity has, instead, reproduced the very mistakes that broke the back of Japanâ€™s economy.
Among these are:
<P>
1.
Statism - As in Japan, Korea's government is central to running the economy.
Statism may be helpful at the threshold of development, where coordination and resource mobilization are needed.
But in time governments cannot handle increasingly complex economic decision-making.
South Korea is victimized by this, with the result that small and medium-sized firms, or new firms, are missing and industrial dinosaurs become another form of bureaucracy not much different from government.
<P>
2.
Dysfunctional finance - For decades government allocated credit.
Today that system cannot effectively channel credits to dynamic new firms.
<P>
3.
Top heavy industrial organization - The predominant role of the chaebols - - monumental in concentration and, unlike anywhere, vast in the range of activities run under one centralized, bureaucratic leadership -- stifles the ability to change.
The situation is complicated by the question of just what these chaebols might do -- invest overseas, break-up, or continue to dominate.
<P>
4.
Competitiveness - Caught between competition from Asia's low wage economies and Japan, Korean manufacturing now faces a daily struggle to get an extra bit of competitiveness.
A transition to more cyclical industries -- durable goods and chips -- means that the world's business cycle will stamp itself even more emphatically on Korea's economy.
<P>
5.
Democratization in the work place - Powerful trade unions -- a general strike was called just before 1996 ended -- brings to an end a time where firms could allow wages to lag behind productivity by years.
<P>
6.
Bureaucracy creates a creativity deficit - Just as in Japan (or Germany) everything functions like clockwork.
But regimentation by bureaucrats stifles.
Despite impressive human capital and technology, risk taking and dramatic innovation have petered out.
<P>
Korea's flagging growth reflects the inevitable slowdown that comes as a country catches up; equal investment rates produce slower growth; and government structures that once were helpful become a hindrance.

Slowdown came to South Korea because of new competition in world trade, the offshore relocation of Japanese factories to lower wage countries, and diminished growth at home.
This environment must not lead to Japanese-style depression.
Immediate currency depreciation should help reduce large external deficits while at the same time providing room for growth without adding to the craving for external financing.

Anytime there is significant currency depreciation markets begin to fear that depreciation will become addictive, an expedient remedy for hard problems.
For Korea, the best exchange rate strategy is to follow the "BBC" -- band, basket, crawl -- approach.
A band feature limits flexibility and allows market forces to play a signaling role -- the Central Bank stops being the currency czar.
The currency basket feature -- rather than a dollar or Yen reference -- takes account of the multinational trade interests of Korea and the crawl recognizes both inflation differentials across countries and an evolving role for the real exchange rate that takes into account the requirements of trade-based growth plus the need to contain current account deficits in the face of external shocks to demand or the terms of trade.
<P>
In the current setting, the exchange market strategy should be: an immediate depreciation of 10% combined with the transition to a BBC regime.
This should happen before Korea joins the OECD and becomes even more subject to international regimentation of its policies.
<P>
The gain in competitiveness that will follow these steps provides a window of opportunity to restructure, reposition industry, and get back some extra growth.
It also risks external deficits that become a source of vulnerability.
Transition to a transparent currency regime creates confidence that Korea is not embarking on a cycle of depreciation.
Here is a word of warning to the hard money crowd: holding an exchange rate at all costs, raising interest rates to defend the situation, playing tough -- is stupid.
That is what Mexico and Scandinavia once did and the entire financial system (then the real economy) went bust.
Hard money people did unlimited damage in the past decade; they sound serious and conservative, but they are out of tune with reality.
In the end, their strategies create larger depreciations and vastly more damage.
<P>
The other part of macro strategy is to reduce real interest rates.
Korean real rates are absurdly high.
With inflation less than 5%, nearly 14% short rates means that real rates are very high.
At a time of dynamism this is not an issue, but when economies turn sluggish, lower real interest rates help.
Of course, depreciation and lower rates will foster both growth and some increase in inflation.
Let there be no doubt that a dynamic economy is well worth the price of a little bit extra inflation.
<P>
The argument for reduced real rates is made more salient by the behavior of the stock market.
Lower stock prices raise the cost of capital.
Thus a reduction in interest rates is entirely appropriate as an offsetting factor, beyond the need for stimulus.
<P>
Should fiscal policy make a contribution to South Korean reform?
Experience in industrialized countries shows that this is a slippery slope.
Far better to keep fiscal policy in check and normalize real interest rates.
Moreover, at a time where pervasive government must be tamed, fiscal expansion is a bad idea in any way other than tax cuts.

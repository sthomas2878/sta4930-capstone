Venezuela without Chávez?
<P>
SANTA MARTA, COLOMBIA – Like all cancer patients, Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez faces three scenarios: a quick cure, prolonged treatment, or an early death.
Whichever way it goes – even if Chávez really is recovering as quickly as he would have us believe – talk in Venezuela about the post-Chávez era has already begun.
<P>
Chávez manages information about his illness and treatment as part of a political strategy.
After his surgery, invoking God, Fidel Castro, the spirits of the savannah, and medical science, he responded to rumors about his illness and made his return from treatment in Havana a double celebration of Venezuela’s bicentennial and of his triumph over cancer.
<P>
Chávez is a master at manipulating the media: after the failed coup against him in 2002, he brandished a crucifix to pardon his adversaries and be pardoned by them.
After his first chemotherapy session, Chávez exclaimed: “I am radically changing my life.”
<P>
Thus far, changes are noticeable in his appearance and slogans, and a certain self-criticism has crept into his public persona.
On his 57th birthday, he wore yellow instead of red, and substituted “Socialist homeland or death” with “We will live and we will win.”
He told his movement: “Those people who dress in red down to their underwear are suspect, and the same goes for the word ‘socialism.’
We have to reflect and introduce changes into our discourse and our actions.”
And he admitted to Venezuelan television that a “lack of efficiency in everyday routine…has endangered the government’s policies many times.”
<P>
But neither his tweets, his image as a sportsman, his government’s televised ministerial meetings, nor the articles in which he lashes out at the opposition have been able to stem a growing perception that his illness has launched an uncertain transition.
<P>
Some of his supporters speak of postponing the forthcoming elections.
Others say that the vote in 2012 could be seen as Chávez’s last re-election, which would allow him to ensure the transition.
Chancellor Nicolás Maduro and Minister of Energy Rafael Ramírez have been mentioned as possible successors, but their scant leadership abilities don’t point to an electoral triumph next year.
<P>
In the meantime, Chávez is striving to minimize the uncertainty.
From Cuba and in Caracas, he makes a show of governing, and he puts the transition in context: “The only transition here, one that we must accelerate and consolidate, is the transition to the socialist model.”
At the same time, he trivializes the leadership question, “I said that I would leave in 2021.
Maybe I’ll go in 2031 when I’m 77.”
<P>
To his older brother Adán, he said sarcastically: “I see you’re preparing for the succession.”
But faithful Adán, the governor of Barinas and a former education minister and ambassador to Cuba, is popular with neither Chávez supporters nor the opposition, owing to his inefficiency and corruption.
<P>
In the wake of his illness, Chávez is trying to strengthen his movement.
He called on the military to “prevent enemy intrigue” from disrupting its unity.
He has tried to win back the support of those who have abandoned his United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) or have stopped voting for it, and to win over those who are neither with him nor against him.
<P>
Today, Chávez is the only one capable of controlling the government, the armed forces, the militias, the PSUV, and even the opposition.
He has become the stable axis of the unstable Venezuela that he has helped to create.
He can radicalize the “revolution,” as he has done in earlier crises, or he can lay down the rules and conditions for the succession in order to prevent the prediction, attributed to the long-time Chávista Diosdado Cabello, from coming true: “Without Chávez, there will be absolutely nothing left.”
<P>
A prompt cure and subsequent humanization of Chávez are seen – both within and outside of Venezuela – as the best scenario.
If his treatment is prolonged, he might try governing with rotating vice-presidents, and, if a prompt cure or prolonged treatment are not possible and elections are postponed, an uncertain transition would be hastened.
Nothing will be easy, given growing problems of security, governability, institutional stability, and economic performance, with the prospect of renewed global recession threatening oil revenues.
<P>
Confronted with the possibility of an unscheduled transition, the Venezuelan armed forces’ role will be difficult, owing to its politicization under Chávez, as well as its internal divisions and corruption.
The military can choose to uphold the elected government, regardless of which party wins, or prevent the eventual triumph of the opposition Mesa de Unidad.
Top-ranking officers of the Bolivarian National Armed Forces have backed the latter scenario in order to show their unconditional respect for Chávez, their Commander-in-Chief.
<P>
The presence of so many armed civilians in Chávez’s beloved militias will raise the stakes even higher.
A report from the National Assembly Defense Commission indicates that 50% of the population possesses arms legally or illegally.
<P>
This context, combined with increasing social polarization, could give rise to chaos and violence.
Adán Chávez called on the PSUV not to forget “the armed fight for power.”
In the middle of a religious healing rite, however, Hugo Chávez was more pacific – and forgot about the PSUV altogether: “Let us place ourselves in God’s hands in order to avoid violence in Venezuela.”

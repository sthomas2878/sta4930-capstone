Sufis under Attack
<P>
NEW YORK – In 2001, Afghanistan’s Taliban government ordered the destruction of the Buddhas of Bamiyan, two sixth-century statues carved into the side of a cliff in central Afghanistan.
Mullah Mohammed Omar, the Taliban leader who ordered the statues’ demolition, declared that, “Muslims should be proud of smashing idols.
It has given praise to God that we have destroyed them.”
The incident has become emblematic of radical Islam’s cultural and religious intolerance.
<P>
But such fanatical forces have damaged Islam’s own religious heritage as well.
Shia and Sunni partisans have bombed each other’s mosques in Iraq, Syria, Pakistan, and elsewhere.
And Sufi places of worship are under attack throughout the Islamic world.
Indeed, recent incidents have called into question Sufism’s ability to survive in its increasingly dangerous neighborhood.
<P>
Westerners’ knowledge of Sufism is often limited to the writings of the thirteenth-century Afghan mystic Jalaluddin Rumi.
A highly trained Islamic scholar, Rumi settled in Konya, Turkey, where he taught religion.
Gradually, under the guidance of his friend and mentor Shams of Tabriz, he turned away from orthodoxy, and decided to pursue a path of introspection and ecstatic worship instead.
<P>
One of America’s bestselling poets, Rumi represents for many New Age Westerners a vague non-religious religion and free-form spiritual quest.
But Rumi and Sufism play a different role in the Muslim world, where they have inspired moderation and religious tolerance for centuries.
<P>
Sufism comprises a variety of independent orders with distinctive beliefs and practices that are derived from numerous saints’ teachings.
Historically, they have welcomed all – men and women, Jews, Christians, and Hindus – into their egalitarian fraternity, teaching that all religions are equal, because they all lead to the Divine.
<P>
All Sufi groups share the conviction that religion’s purpose is not simply to obey laws and perform rituals; intimate personal communion with the Divine is crucial.
As a result, unlike orthodox Muslims, Sufis use music, dance, and poetry to reach a state of spiritual ecstasy.
<P>
Sufis also pray at the tombs of holy people – sites that they regard as spiritually powerful.
<P>
But hardline Muslims often accuse Sufis of subverting Islamic law, calling them “pagans” and “idolators.”
So, as more aggressive, nationalist forms of Islam have flourished across the Middle East, Sufis have largely retreated from public view.
<P>
Still, Sufism remains popular in much of the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and the Indian subcontinent.
According to some estimates, practitioners could number in the tens of millions, with hundreds of millions more participating in Sufi festivals and worshiping at Sufi shrines.
<P>
But Sufism’s grassroots popularity threatens the narrow view of Islam that extremists propagate, resulting in repeated attacks throughout the Islamic world.
For example, this summer, the radical Islamist militia Ansar Dine took advantage of the chaos that has gripped northern Mali in the wake of a coup to desecrate mausoleums of Sufi saints in Timbuktu, which has been a center of Islamic learning since the fifteenth century.
Despite international calls to stop the attacks, the Al Qaeda-linked group managed to raze more than half of the fabled city’s ancient monuments, including several UNESCO World Heritage sites.
<P>
Then, earlier this month, ultraconservative Islamists demolished Sufi shrines and set fire to a mosque library in Zliten, Libya.
The next day, Salafists bulldozed the Sha’ab mosque (and the more than 50 Sufi tombs that it contained) in the center of Tripoli in broad daylight – uninterrupted by security forces, who were at the scene.
And three Salafi militants died when local residents were forced to defend the Sidi Al-Lafi mausoleum near Benghazi.
<P>
Under former President Hosni Mubarak, Egypt’s government instituted a ban on Sufi zikr – rituals devoted to the remembrance of God.
Since his ouster, at least 20 Sufi sanctuaries have been torched and ransacked.
<P>
By far the bloodiest attacks against Sufi places of worship have occurred in Pakistan, where the Taliban has desecrated Sufi holy places in more than a dozen bombings since 2005.
In July 2010, a double suicide bombing of the Data Darbar, the biggest Sufi shrine in Pakistan’s second-largest city, Lahore, killed 42 people.
<P>
Violence against individual dervishes and Sufi practitioners is also on the rise.
In August, a female suicide bomber killed Effendi Chirkeisky, the Sufi leader of Dagestan, and six of his followers at his home.
Chirkeisky, the second Sufi leader to be assassinated in Dagestan this year, had been a vocal critic of Wahhabism, the Saudi petrodollar-funded brand of orthodoxy that has been gaining traction in the region.
<P>
Iran’s Mullah-led government is also repressing dervishes.
Human-rights activists report thousands of arrests of Iranian Sufis in recent years.
Some were tortured and forced to sign documents renouncing Sufism.
Militants chanting “death to the American dervishes” have attacked Sufis’ homes and destroyed shrines near Shiraz, Isfahan, and elsewhere in Iran.
<P>
To be sure, the Sufis have had some good fortune.
According to the US State Department, the number of Iranian Sufis has grown significantly since 1979, perhaps partly in response to state-imposed orthodoxy.
While no official statistics exist, some estimate that more than two million people practice Sufism in Iran.
<P>
Moreover, the Algerian authorities have actively promoted Sufism as an antidote to the Salafi fundamentalism that has fueled violent clashes between government forces and Islamist rebels.
A study by the RAND Corporation also advocates the promotion of Sufism, whose gentler and more inclusive version of Islam makes its adherents ideal “partners in the effort to combat Islamist extremism.”
<P>
But Sufis do not need – or want – help spreading their age-old belief system.
Rather, they need Western governments and human-rights organizations to work to protect them in countries where they are increasingly imperiled.

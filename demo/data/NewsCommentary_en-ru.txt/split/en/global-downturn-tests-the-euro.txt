Global Downturn Tests the Euro
<P>
LONDON:The crises in southeast Asia, Russia, and Latin America are confronting the European single currency with its first major challenge.
For now, the over-riding priority for the EU is the successful launch of the euro on January 1, regardless of the world’s economic storms.
But if the European fallout from Asia and Russia turns out to be severe, European Union governments may be compelled to re-examine the single currency’s deflationary bias.
<P>
Earlier this month, the Group of Seven top industrialised countries responded to growing fears of a world economic slowdown, by pledging to sustain growth-oriented policies in their own economies.
<P>
Many commentators at first took this for a signal that the rich countries stood ready to reduce interest rates, to counter the deflationary pressures from southeast Asia and Russia.
But those expectations were quickly quashed when Hans Tietmeyer, President of the German Bundesbank, and Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, both disclaimed any prospect of a concerted reduction of interest rates.
<P>
Mr Tietmeyer pointed out that the main economies in Europe are growing strongly, so they do not need an extra stimulus from a rate cut.
Moreover, the most immediate monetary task facing the European Union, is the need to move towards a new single interest rate in time for the launch of the single currency on January 1 next year.
<P>
What that interest rate should be is debated, since economic conditions are not the same in all member states.
But it is obvious that the European Central Bank will be influenced by the domestic economic needs of Germany and France rather than by those of Russia, Latin America, or southeast Asia.
<P>
But the most important reason why Europe is unlikely to take any public-spirited new measures to buoy up the world economy, is that the rules of Europe's single currency system were constructed to make such action virtually impossible.
<P>
The Maastricht system’s two complementary mechanisms, a European Central Bank for monetary policy, and a set of budgetary rules for member states' fiscal policies, are both rigid in their objectives: combatting inflation.
<P>
The G7 declaration acknowledged what many people have recognised for some time, that the balance of risks in the world economy had shifted away from inflation.
But this new situation is not allowed for in the Maastricht system.
The responsibilities of the US Federal Reserve include a wide range of concerns, including growth as well as the control of inflation; but the responsibility of the European Central Bank is exclusively with containing inflation.
<P>
Moreover, Europe’s single currency system rests on the solipsistic assumption that Euro-land is a closed system which can be managed without reference to anything happening outside.
It certainly makes no provision for adapting European economic policy in the light of conditions in the rest of the world, or even for attempting to manage the exchange rate between the euro and other currencies like the dollar.
<P>
The Maastricht Treaty imposes on governments a duty of fiscal prudence, which it defines as a maximum budget deficit of 3% of GDP.
At the insistence of the Germans, this criterion has been tightened, turned into a more austere target of zero deficits, on average, over the economic cycle.
So while some officials from the G7 countries were preparing a communiqué earlier this month which appeared to offer the possibility of a more expansionary policy in western economies, other officials from the 11 Euroland countries were putting the finishing touches to the so-called "Growth and Stability Pact", which will require further budget tightening in future.
<P>
Historically, this anti-inflationary bias was explicable and even reasonable.
Inflation was long one of Europe’s chief economic scourges, and the Germans were unwilling to give up the Deutschemark without guarantees against the spendthrift tendencies of some of their partners.
<P>
As a result, the Maastricht Treaty makes it impossible for the Europeans to re-orientate their economic policies to off-set today’s global crises; some governments also believe the euro will insulate them from these crises.
As Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the French finance minister, said the other day: "The euro brought us growth and now it is protecting it".
<P>
But if these crises turn out to be anything like as severe as some experts forecast, the deflationary bias of the single currency system, and the complacency of some European governments, will start to look much less reasonable.
As it is, a number of European countries, starting with France and Italy, are revising their economic growth forecasts downwards, and the European Commission will produce its own revised forecasts for the whole of Euroland on October 21.
<P>
It may become more difficult for countries like France and Italy to keep their deficits below the critical 3% ceiling.
But the central economic problem in France (and Germany, too) is unemployment, stuck at around 11% for several years.
The big danger, if growth peters out, is that the euro may not produce the employment dividend on which governments are counting.
<P>
If that happens, we can expect a re-opening of the European debate over EMU, between the expansionists and the anti-inflationists.
Remember, the French socialist government is a late and semi-reluctant convert to the EMU project.
When it came to power 18 months ago, it looked as though it might refuse to accept EMU’s deflationary constraints.
And though it soon conformed in practice, it has consistently contested the legitimacy of the Maastricht anti-inflation rules, and argues in favour of a greater emphasis on economic growth.
<P>
On every occasion in the past, France always lost the argument of principle, mainly because a conservative German government was on the other side of the argument.
But if the economic downturn in the outside world should turn out to be as severe as many analysts predict, EU governments are unlikely to submit passively to the combined deflationary effects of a world downturn and the anti-inflation bias of the Maastricht Treaty, without any effort to find a better policy.

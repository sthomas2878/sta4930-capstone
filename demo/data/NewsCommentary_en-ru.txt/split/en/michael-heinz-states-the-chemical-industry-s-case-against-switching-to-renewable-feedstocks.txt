Sustainable Consumption Through Better Chemistry
<P>
LUDWIGSHAFEN,GERMANY – The chemical industry is committed to sustainable consumption.
But doesthis mean that it should switch completely from fossil feedstocks – oil, gas,and coal – to renewable resources, as environmentalists often demand?
In fact, theindustry is already making this switch – whenever and wherever it makes sense.
Butit does not always make sense, and there are various ways in which the industrycan protect the environment.
<P>
Renewable rawmaterials account for around 4% of BASF’s total feedstock.
In certain businesses,such as care chemicals (used for personal hygiene and home care and so forth),the figure can be much higher, depending on the market and the level of demand.But, even if the share of renewables were suddenly and dramatically increased, thiswould not necessarily produce the desired outcomes, because being “bio-based”is not intrinsically sustainable, and sustainable consumption does not involve onlyreplacing fossil with renewable feedstock.
<P>
Despite claims tothe contrary, renewable feedstock is finite, too, and its production is often associatedwith challenges such as deforestation, changing land use, and marginalization offood production.
In short, we are a long way from having a clear picture ofthese complex interactions.
<P>
To take one example,BASF has developed a compostable plastic that can be used to make bags to helpcollect organic waste and turn it into a valuable resource.
But developing anew technology and a smart product is not enough.
Compostable plastics also needto be composted.
In the absence of local waste-management companies with appropriatesystems for collecting and composting the bags, their environmental benefitsare limited.
<P>
It is true thatrenewable raw materials are gaining in importance as alternative feedstock,especially in new areas such as the production of enzymes, which reduce energyconsumption by acting as bio-catalysts in low-temperature detergents.
Nevertheless,for the foreseeable future, fossil feedstock will remain the dominant rawmaterials in many areas of the chemical industry.
<P>
Efficient use offeedstock is not a modern trend; on the contrary, it is based on longexperience in the chemical industry.
Although the industry consumes around 10%of the world’s oil output, it does so with great care.
Indeed, our experience ingetting the most out of every barrel is what has kept us in business for morethan a century.
<P>
But the industry’s mainpositive impact on the environment is felt in numerous indirect ways.
Insulationmaterials (which reduce buildings’ heating and cooling needs), wind turbines,and solar-power modules would not exist without contributions from the chemicalindustry.
<P>
The chemical industryhelps other sectors produce a vast range of environmentally friendly, everyday productsthat consumers are increasingly demanding, including shampoos, mobile phones,paper, tennis shoes, clothes, medicines, and cars.
Over their lifecycle,chemical products made in 2010, for example, will be responsible for areduction in greenhouse-gas emissions equal to 30% of the European Union’stotal emissions that year.
<P>
Our industry hasalways been at the forefront of innovation.
A century ago, a BASF scientist helpedto develop an industrial process to make ammonia from hydrogen and atmosphericnitrogen.
This formed the basis for the industrial production of nitrogenfertilizers, which allow us to produce enough food for the world’s ever-increasingpopulation.
<P>
Today, our concernsare more environmental.
For example, we believe that converting oil intospecial plastics for lighter-weight vehicles, thereby lowering fuel consumption,would make more sense than burning it as gasoline or diesel.
But, in developingsuch innovative approaches to emissions reductions, we must always specify theoptimal feedstock for each product, and find the right balance between fossilfeedstock and renewable resources.
<P>
The move towardsustainable consumption must be realistic.
For the chemical industry,sustainability means much more than only minimizing the impact on theenvironment.
It must also be economically viable and socially accepted.
<P>
Likewise, sustainabilitygoals will not be met by focusing entirely on rich, industrialized countries.
Achievingsustainable consumption requires global dialog all along the value chain.
Itmeans learning from, and exchanging ideas with, all stakeholders, be theygovernments, trade associations, or civil-society organizations.
We at BASF arewilling and able to contribute meaningfully to such a dialog.

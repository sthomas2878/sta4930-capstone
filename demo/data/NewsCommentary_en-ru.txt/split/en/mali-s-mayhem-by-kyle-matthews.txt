Mali’s Mayhem
<P>
MONTREAL – Last week, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC, organized a symposium entitled “Imagine the Unimaginable: Ending Genocide in the Twenty-first Century.”
In a poignant and topical keynote address, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton underscored the international community’s obligation to prevent all forms of atrocity.
“Not every mass killing is announced,” she noted, “[but] there are slow-motion conflicts that happen every day.”
<P>
Clinton’s message resonates deeply with the current crisis in Mali, whose government recently submitted an official request to the International Criminal Court for an investigation into the rampant human-rights abuses in the country’s rebel-controlled north.
The ICC’s lead prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda Bensouda, noted reports of widespread killings, rapes, and torture, as well as conscription of child soldiers.
<P>
The Malian government’s move signaled that it can no longer uphold its United Nations-mandated “responsibility to protect” its citizens.
In such cases, the international community must step in to protect civilians and bring perpetrators to justice.
<P>
Mali’s crisis was triggered in March by a coup d’état in the capital, Bamako.
As the military seized control of the government in the south, rebel groups armed with sophisticated weaponry from Libya took advantage of the chaos to occupy the north, an area the size of France.
<P>
Despite their very different objectives, Tuareg separatists and Islamic radicals joined forces in a marriage of convenience, taking control of Timbuktu, Kidal, and Gao.
The Tuareg separatists have since been pushed aside by the Islamist groups Ansar Dine, the Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa, and Al Qaeda of the Islamic Maghreb, alongside individuals with ties to Somalia’s al-Shabaab movement and Nigeria’s Boko Haram.
<P>
These radical groups, which vehemently oppose the Sufi Islam that flourishes in Mali, are committing acts of brutal violence against Malians as they seek to impose a strict version of Sharia law.
Intimidation, harassment, physical abuse, and rape have become their tools of oppression.
<P>
The UN High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that roughly 360,000 people have been forced to flee, while more than 200,000 people have sought asylum in neighboring countries.
In the wake of this exodus, the mayor of Timbuktu describes his city, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, as a “ghost town.”
The city has been ransacked, and important historical and religious sites destroyed, robbing Mali of a crucial source of tourism revenue.
<P>
To be sure, Mali’s citizens were vulnerable even before the uprising began.
The country has been suffering from famine, and recent reports warn of a deadly locust outbreak in the region.
Indeed, the situation is likely to get worse before it gets better.
<P>
But the international community must not make matters worse by leaving Malians at the mercy of an international network of armed religious zealots.
Coordinated action in accordance with international law is critical to protect Mali from becoming what some are calling “Africa’s Afghanistan.”
<P>
Countries that participated in the 2011 UN-authorized, NATO-led mission in Libya – especially the United States, France, the United Kingdom, and Canada – have a heightened responsibility to respond to the crisis in Mali.
While these countries protected Libyans from Muammar el-Qaddafi’s predatory regime, they limited their engagement to the sky and coastal waters, and thus did not control the spillover of looted weapons.
<P>
As a result, weapons and fighters moved into Mali, giving the country’s simmering insurgency the necessary tools to launch a violent campaign against innocent civilians – with the potential to reignite the civil war that ravaged the area in 1990-1996.
Malians have become victims of the Libyan intervention.
<P>
The UN Security Council remains deadlocked over Syria, with Russia and China blocking any action.
But that is no excuse for leaving Mali to the wolves.
The West must bolster Mali’s transitional government, while providing diplomatic support, logistical capacity, and guidance to the Economic Community of West African States.
<P>
Mali is now a hub of African jihadi groups.
If the international community does not act, these groups will become more powerful, leading to further atrocities, destabilizing neighboring countries, and producing spillover effects that could reach as far as Western Europe.
Clinton and other Western policymakers would be wise to remember that actions speak louder than words.

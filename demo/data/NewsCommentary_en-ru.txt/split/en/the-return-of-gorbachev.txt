The Return of Gorbachev
<P>
Remember Mikhail Gorbachev?
<P>
These days, Gorbachev runs a foundation, based in San Francisco, which runs well-meaning conferences about world affairs.
In a few weeks the Gorbachev Foundation will hold a particularly lavish event: speakers will include everyone from former US President George Bush to chimpanzee expert Jane Goodall -- and, I am somewhat ashamed to admit, me.
I am a bit ashamed because I can predict in advance that it will be a very silly event: pretentious, bombastic, and forgotten within days.
I agreed to attend only because it is taking place in my neighborhood and I thought it might be fun.
<P>
Although the Gorbachev conference will undoubtedly be a fairly ridiculous event, however, the program is in a way interesting.
Fancy international conferences are almost never of high intellectual quality, but they do give you an indication of what is on the minds of influential people.
In this case the assembled group is quite broad in political orientation: it contains people as conservative as George Bush, but it also contains quite a few leftists.
Yet there is a common theme that clearly appeals to all of these people.
The official themes are things like "Expanding the boundaries of humanness'"; but the real theme, as I read it, is nostalgia for an earlier time.
<P>
A generation ago, it was a simpler world.
East was East, West was West -- and also North was North and South was South.
That is, there were two rival economic systems, communism and capitalism; and there was a seemingly permanent division of the world into rich and poor nations.
In that divided and in a way static world, international meetings had a strangely comfortable tone.
Because market and command economies seemed to be at opposite poles, it did not require much imagination to pontificate about future economic systems: all you had to do was sagely recommend combining the best features of each.
Because the poor nations would, it seemed, always be with us, there was a permanent role for proposals to share the wealth through some kind of New International Economic Order.
Participants in the solemn conferences organized in various vacation spots around the world were able to feel wise and noble, secure in the secret knowledge that nobody would ever take their proposals seriously.
<P>
What is so striking about the agenda for Gorbachev's conference is that much of it was written as if the last 20 years have never happened.
There is a session entitled "21st century economics: beyond capitalism and communism" -- as if that were still a live rivalry.
There is a session entitled "Sharing global resources", which appears to be a return to the old New International Economic Order idea that rich countries are somehow stealing the resources of the poor.
And to an extraordinary extent even the participants will be people who became famous for their advocacy of causes that have not so much been lost as made irrelevant by events.
<P>
This nostalgia for the past is not unique to Mr. Gorbachev and his conference organizers.
The current issue of the intellectual magazine Deadalus not only contains an essay entitled "We live in an age of transition" by none other than that icon of the Cold War, Henry Kissinger (does he realize that he has become a caricature of himself?), but actually reprints the minutes of a 1965 conference on global order.
<P>
This is all very funny, but it is also alarming, because it suggests that the world's elite is wilfully out of touch with what is really going on out there.
<P>
There is, of course, no longer any question of a conflict between communism and capitalism.
The real contenders among economic and political systems seem to be a relatively humane welfare-state capitalism -- which is the system that defeated Communism, but which seems to be falling apart in both Europe and North America; a raw frontier-style capitalism, with few protections for the unlucky -- a system that seems to be the objective of conservatives in the United States, and may be the eventual outcome in much of Europe; and an oligarchy in which the power of the state is used to further the interests of the elite, with little pretense of either socialism or democracy -- the system that now prevails in China and to a lesser extent in some other Asian developing countries, and that could easily become the future of much of the former Soviet Empire.
<P>
And the old division of the world into rich and poor nations has also, of course, broken down.
On the contrary, in the 1990s the world's fast-growing countries are all newly industrializing economies, mainly in Asia, while advanced nations are stagnating -- even Japan now seems to be stuck in a rut.
<P>
This brave new world may be much less comfortable for established elites than the world of the 1970s, it is actually on the whole a much better place to live in.
The new regimes of Asia and Eastern Europe are sometimes brutal, often corrupt -- but they are much better than what came before.
The surge of growth in the newly industrializing economies has created some strains in the advanced countries; but any adverse effect on the poor in Europe or America must be set against the emergence of perhaps a billion people from abject poverty to at least the glimmerings of a decent life.
<P>
But this new world apparently confuses and repels influential people -- and their response is one of denial.
If the Gorbachev conference -- or any of a dozen other high-level conferences whose programs I have seen but to which I either was not invited or had the good sense to decline -- is an indicator, hardly anyone even wants to think about the real issues -- like how to maintain the necessary institutions of world order, from international policing to more or less free trade, when economic power is no longer restricted to a handful of wealthy nations.
<P>
And so we march into the future, our eyes firmly fixed on the past.

How to Achieve Health Equity
<P>
WASHINGTON, DC – In 2015, the world committed to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals – a comprehensive agenda covering virtually all aspects of development – by 2030.
But the world has yet to embrace the kind of deliberate, systematic, and inclusive approach that is needed to eliminate inequities that prevent billions of people from enjoying a long and healthy life.

Following its targeted killing of Iran's second most powerful leader, the US could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the Middle East, a path that could lead to additional Iranian provocations.
And that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to US interests elsewhere in the world.
<P>
The targeted killing by the United States of one of Iran's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the Iranian regime, but it does not augur all-out war.
After all, Iran and the US have already been at war for decades, and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now.

As in previous years, Project Syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months.
If there is one common theme in this year's selection, it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come.
<P>
Last year’s United Nations report on progress toward achieving the SDGs showed that the number of people facing hunger is actually growing, as is the number of malaria cases.
Moreover, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the consequences of climate change are emerging much faster than anticipated.
The world’s poorest and most vulnerable will be disproportionately affected.

This is no way to fulfill the pledge contained in the SDG framework, called the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, that “no one will be left behind.”
But it should not come as a surprise.
The world has made limited efforts to eliminate inequities, including in health.
The SDGs’ predecessor, the Millennium Development Goals, brought modest improvements in health equity for many countries, but in a substantial minority of countries, poorer segments of the population fell even further behind.

In Nigeria, access to basic reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health interventions remains five times higher for those in the top wealth quintile than those in the lowest (68%, compared to 13%).
In Bangladesh, 74% of the wealthiest quintile has access to skilled childbirth care, whereas only 18% of the poorest does.
<P>
Serious health inequities persist even in the advanced economies.
In the United States, residents of Baltimore’s largely white and wealthy Roland Park neighborhood can expect to live 16 years longer than residents of the largely black, impoverished Greenmount East neighborhood, located just a few miles away.
<P>
Ensuring that the SDGs succeed where the MDGs did not demands a carefully designed, comprehensive, and inclusive response that directly tackles “the inequitable distribution of power, money, and resources” that underlies health inequities.
The health equity programs of action framework, proposed by the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at the Georgetown University Law Center, aims to facilitate the development of just such a response.
<P>
Grounded in countries’ human rights obligations, the programs of action could be implemented through national health plans or through national development, SDG, or social inclusion strategies.
They would adhere to seven principles:
<P>
We have less than 12 years to achieve the SDGs.
Without a comprehensive and steadfast effort to eliminate health inequities – the kind promoted by health equity programs of action – we will fail.
That is why countries should urgently adapt the seven principles to their circumstances and incorporate them into their health and development planning processes.
To this end, they can take advantage of the newly released implementation framework for health equity programs of action.
<P>
The UN and the World Health Organization – whose principles are consistent with those of the health equity programs of action – should encourage governments to adopt this framework.
So should development and funding agencies, including the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, as well as civil-society organizations.
<P>
Health inequities are not inevitable.
They are the product of injustices that people have created.
Eliminating those injustices is within our power as well.

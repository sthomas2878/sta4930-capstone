How Banning Abortion Will Transform America
<P>
HUNEDOARA, ROMANIA – “It was a horrible time,” recounts one Romanian gynecologist, referring to the period between 1966 and 1990, when abortion and contraception were completely banned under the dictatorship of Nicolae Ceaușescu.
“Women refused to have sexual lives, resulting in family fights and abandonment,” she continued.
“For a woman, any sexual contact meant only panic and pain.”
As another Romanian who lived through the period put it, “It was impossible to have a normal sexual life because of fear of getting pregnant.”

Following its targeted killing of Iran's second most powerful leader, the US could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the Middle East, a path that could lead to additional Iranian provocations.
And that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to US interests elsewhere in the world.
<P>
The targeted killing by the United States of one of Iran's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the Iranian regime, but it does not augur all-out war.
After all, Iran and the US have already been at war for decades, and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now.

As in previous years, Project Syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months.
If there is one common theme in this year's selection, it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come.

If the Republican Party in the United States has its way, millions of American women could soon come to know the same fear.
Republican lawmakers in Georgia, Alabama, and other states have enacted or are proposing outright abortion bans, hoping to bring the issue back before a sympathetic US Supreme Court and overturn or further gut the landmark 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade.
In the absence of Roe’s constitutional protection of a woman’s right to have an abortion, America would become a different society, because, as in Ceaușescu-era Romania, the government would police its members’ most personal choices.

It wasn’t only women who suffered from the Ceaușescu regime’s attacks on their bodily integrity.
Far from strengthening the family, Romania’s draconian “pro-life” policies poisoned heterosexual intimacy, strained marriages, and weakened social trust.
Monthly gynecological exams brought the state inside women’s uteruses and, by extension, into the bedroom.
State surveillance of sexual activity resembled that of a farmer breeding livestock.
With provisions prohibiting women from going out of state for an abortion, or from using certain contraceptive methods (such as intrauterine devices), much of the new US legislation, if upheld by the Supreme Court, would expose women to a similar enforcement regime.
<P>
After the Ceaușescu regime fell in December 1989, one of the interim Romanian government’s first moves was to decriminalize abortion.
While debates about many aspects of the communist legacy soon erupted, few Romanians had any doubt that forcing women to have babies they didn’t want had been disastrous for the country.
<P>
Even after three decades under the ban, Romania’s birth rate had not increased.
Instead, Romanian women had undergone nearly 7.3 million back-alley abortions – an average of three apiece – between 1967 and 1989.
At least 15,000 women died as a result of complications and untreated side effects.
Romania’s infant-mortality rate during this period was the highest in Europe, and anywhere from two to 59 times above that of other countries.
<P>
Though most Eastern Bloc countries expanded women’s reproductive freedoms after Stalin’s death in 1953, by the late 1960s, communist leaders began to worry that declining birth rates would lead to future labor shortages.
But while other East European countries addressed the issue through longer paid maternity leaves and higher child-care benefits, the Romanian government took a different path.
<P>
Prior to 1966, Romania had one of the most liberal abortion policies in the world.
But, desperate for population growth, Ceaușescu issued Decree 770, essentially nationalizing Romanian women’s wombs.
Both abortion and contraception were criminalized for all women age 45 and under who had not borne at least four children (later increased to five).
The only exceptions were for rape and incest, high-risk pregnancies, and cases in which the fetus could contract a hereditary disease from either parent.
The law was strictly enforced.
The Romanian secret police, the Securitate, registered suspected pregnancies and kept tabs on women until the birth of the child.
It was the kind of natalist authoritarianism that US "pro-life" advocates have long dreamed of.
<P>
With challenges to Roe looming on the horizon, and with many US states having already denied access to abortion facilities and reproductive health services through other means, Romania’s experience shows what happens when women suddenly lose the right to control their own bodies.
Without reproductive freedom, heterosexual sex turns into a game of “Russian roulette” for women, because they quite literally bear the consequences of any liaison.
Indeed, Alabama’s new law goes further than Ceaușescu’s Romania, by eliminating even the exception for rape or incest.
<P>
Abortion opponents claim that banning it will promote marriage, strengthen families, and restore traditional gender roles.
But the Romanian case shows that a more likely scenario is a rapid increase in maternal mortality, an explosion of unwanted children and orphans, and a “sex recession,” as wives choose to avoid intimacy with their husbands altogether.
As in Romania, the state’s violent intrusion into the private sphere will upset the lives of men and women alike.
Americans can look forward to a future of bad sex and wrecked relationships.
<P>
It’s time to face facts.
A century of evidence from around the world shows that coercive reproduction policies correlate weakly with actual fertility rates.
The fact is that women’s decisions about family size are based on material realities.
When basic food supplies are scarce (as in Romania in the 1980s), women will risk their lives having back-alley abortions, for fear of lacking the means to care for a child.
Where paid parental leave and childcare are absent or prohibitively expensive, as they are in the US, women will make similar economic choices, regardless of the laws on the books.
<P>
After communism, Romania's people recognized that democratic societies have a responsibility to guarantee women’s bodily autonomy, and to respect the right of all citizens to make their own decisions about whether and when to start or add to a family.
It is odd that in the “land of the free,” one of the major parties would emulate a communist dictator.

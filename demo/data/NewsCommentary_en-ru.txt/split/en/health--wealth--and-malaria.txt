Health, Wealth, and Malaria
<P>
Health and economic performance are interrelated.
Infant mortality, child mortality, and life expectancy all correlate with rising income.
In four random countries in which the average annual income ranged, in 1990, from $660, to $1,727, to $3,795, to $11,422, infant mortality ranged from 114, to 66, to 34, to 9 (per thousand).
As income doubles, infant survival tends to rise proportionately, a trend reflected in other measures of health and of wealth.
<P>
Different health conditions impede development in characteristic ways.
HIV/AIDS for example, destroys the lives of workers in their most productive years and orphans millions of children.
This combined effect will damage societies for generations, while discouraging investment today.
<P>
Malaria's economic impact is more insidious, particularly where transmission is most intense.
In contrast to HIV/AIDS, young children rather than working adults are most affected.
Some 300 million people become ill with malaria each year, causing 1.5 million deaths, most of them small children.
Children who survive malaria develop into relatively immune adults.
But visitors to a malaria infested country, because they lack this immunity, share the risks borne by local children.
<P>
Precisely because malaria differs in this way from other infections, its economic harm is so huge.
No other disease is so prevalent, so rooted in the landscape, and so asymmetrical in its effects on visitors and residents.
Although it once protected people in tropical areas by scaring away colonial invaders, malaria now burdens those same people by scaring investors and other outsiders away.
<P>
The effect on foreign direct investment stands out as a crucial factor linking poverty and malaria.
Industries shun malarious regions, except where valuable resources can be extracted or where particular kinds of agriculture require unique environmental conditions.
Malaria-related health insurance costs for expatriate workers and their families provide a powerful disincentive for manufacturing activities.
<P>
Where malaria transmission is less intense and immunities are not developed, epidemics occasionally sweep through the local population, taking a heavy toll of lives in all age-groups.
Such outbreaks are explosive, affecting the entire population in mere weeks.
In urban areas, where indigenous workers tend to lack immunity to malaria, occasional episodes of the disease result in reduced productivity.
This further contributes to the reluctance of foreign companies to invest in malaria-ridden regions, despite otherwise low labor costs.
<P>
Ill health due to malaria also directly reduces household income by incapacitating workers, causing lost work time, time lost for child-care, impaired cognitive development, and adverse effects during pregnancy resulting in low birth weight and producing physical disabilities.
Malaria further obstructs travel, industrial activities, commerce and tourism.
Indeed, malaria's effect on tourism is important because of tourism's role in bringing foreign exchange to developing countries.
<P>
Malaria not only inhibits foreign investment, but also contributes to the "brain drain" of local talent by inhibiting people from returning home after prolonged stays abroad.
Thus, people who go abroad for advanced education fear the loss of the partial immunity they once enjoyed and tend to find work elsewhere, rather than return home.
This is likely to be most true for those who acquire families abroad because their children are likely to become ill when they return to their parent's homelands.
<P>
All in all, the vast bulk of malaria's weight falls on developing countries, particularly those in sub-Saharan Africa, and evidence of a reciprocal relationship with poverty has become increasingly evident.
Malaria causes poverty, while poverty causes malaria - far more than other diseases.
<P>
By all calculations, the burdens imposed by malaria on economic growth are huge.
In countries where transmission is intense, incomes tend to be a third less than in other countries.
Growth is reduced by 1.3% annually, and the total economic costs of malaria add up to about 1% of annual GDP.
No other human condition appears to result in such a disjunction between its (relatively mild) direct effects on local populations and its total effect on national economies.
<P>
The link between poverty and malaria suggests that sub-Saharan countries cannot develop economically unless something is done about the disease.
But fighting malaria also poses particular problems because so much of the disease's economic burden is indirect, threatening the lives of non-immune visitors to endemic sites.
In fact, anti-malaria measures undertaken to address health goals may not fully address the economic ones.
<P>
Anti-malaria efforts traditionally focus on distributing insecticide-treated bed-nets and drugs to vulnerable residents of a region.
Although human lives can be saved by this kind of assistance to the "poorest of the poor," efforts to promote economic development might more effectively focus on other modes of intervention, such as environmental management, housing improvement, applications of residual insecticide, and efforts against the mosquitoes that transmit the infection.
<P>
These kinds of interventions, seeking to reduce the force of transmission, aim at the creation of an environment that is likely to serve as an "engine of economic growth."
They target communities rather than individuals and should be supported by public investment.
In particular, in addition to individual life-saving efforts, strategies should be implemented to reduce the risk of infection in port cities and other centers of economic activity.
<P>
As the applicability of a vaccine-based approach to malaria has not yet been demonstrated, what anti-malaria efforts must above all strive to achieve is a balance between interventions designed to produce immediate health benefits and those that might eliminate malaria as an obstacle to economic development.

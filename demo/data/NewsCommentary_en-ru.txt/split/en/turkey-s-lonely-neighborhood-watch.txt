Turkey’s Lonely Neighborhood Watch
<P>
ISTANBUL – For nearly a decade, Turkey benefited from a strategic environment that allowed it to raise its profile, widen its zone of autonomous action, and aspire to regional power in the Middle East.
<P>
So, now, as the slaughter in Syria continues, those who want to stop the bloodletting look to Turkey.
After futile attempts to convince Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad to begin a transition to a more open system, the Turkish government has unequivocally called for Assad’s departure, and is actively trying to secure a legitimate framework for intervention.
<P>
Turkey has a 900-kilometer (560-mile) border with Syria, close social ties, and what seems to be a well-developed intelligence network.
If the international community finds a legitimate way to intervene in Syria, Turkey’s military contribution to any operation would be assumed.
But, despite tremendous pressure from its allies and others, Turkey is unlikely to intervene unilaterally, or to arm the rebel army on its territory.
<P>
Like the rest of the world, the Turkish government was caught by surprise when the Arab revolts began.
Although Turkey saw these developments as positive and auspicious, it had to improvise its policy while trying not to veer from its principles.
The unfolding events were seen as the dénouement of colonialism and the Cold War in the Middle East.
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was the first leader anywhere to urge Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to step down.
But other cases were not so simple to navigate.
Libya’s popular uprising, for example, left Turkey’s government caught between the country’s economic interests and its unilateralist regional inclinations, on the one hand, and its traditional alliances, on the other.
<P>
In the end, Turkey joined its allies in implementing United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973, which established a legal basis for military intervention in Libya.
But it adamantly opposed any involvement of ground troops.
In sum, when the chips were down, Turkey, unlike Germany, chose to work with its allies.
<P>
Syria has proved to be a more complicated case.
The decade preceding the uprising was a period of deepening rapprochement, with Turkey investing heavily in Syria.
In the wake of the Iraq war and the assassination of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafic Hariri, Turkey provided diplomatic cover to the besieged Baath regime.
Trade grew tenfold, and the removal of visa requirements led to a massive increase in travel between the two countries.
Joint cabinet meetings were scheduled to take place.
<P>
Turkey worked relentlessly to mediate a peace agreement between Israel and Syria, and brokered proximity talks for nearly two years.
But, just when Turkey believed that its efforts were bearing fruit, and that direct talks were in the offing, Israel invaded Gaza.
The nascent peace talks were scuttled, and Turkish-Israeli relations have yet to recover.
<P>
Turkey believed that by engaging Syria, it could lure the Assad regime away from its close alliance with Iran.
Indeed, both Syria and Lebanon were sites of strategic competition between Iran and Turkey.
<P>
But, after eight months of futile efforts to encourage Syria’s regime to pursue a reasonable course of action, Turkey ended up urging Assad to step down.
The Turkish government has now firmly sided with the Syrian opposition, whose representative organization, the Syrian National Council, is located in the country.
The Free Syrian Army is also in Turkey, its ranks beefed up by the recent defection of seven generals.
<P>
But, while Turkey’s allies expect it to take the lead in dealing with the current impasse over Syria, the Erdoğan government will not act unless it receives support from the UN Security Council (unlikely, given Russian and Chinese support for Assad) or another legitimate international body.
Thus far, the government has refrained from opening a humanitarian corridor or establishing a security zone inside Syria.
It also claims not to be arming the rebel army.
<P>
At one level, Syria’s crisis is Turkey’s moment, but it also highlights the limits of Turkey’s unilateralism and prowess as a regional power.
Indeed, the violence in Syria demonstrates that Turkey’s capacity for autonomous action in its region has diminished over the course of the Arab Spring and following the withdrawal of American troops from Iraq.
<P>
Thus, for example, Turkey’s competition with Iran over Iraqi politics and the crisis in Syria has intensified, though bilateral dialogue about Iran’s nuclear program continues.
Turkey has a keen interest in resuming negotiations and averting a catastrophic military operation against Iran’s nuclear facilities.
In the meantime, Turkey and the United States have a mutual interest in working together in Iraq, Syria, and Iran.
<P>
But, as Turkey builds closer relations with the US, and its competition with Iran stiffens in both Iraq and Syria, it will also have to deal with a more assertive Russia, which is eager to prove itself in the Middle East and Eastern Mediterranean – and to maintain its foothold in Syria.
<P>
For better or worse, the status quo in the Middle East has unraveled, and Turkey must reassess and recalibrate its regional policies.
Turkey’s real strengths are its flourishing economy, secular democratic system, and ability to mediate between its Western allies and a region that is struggling to join the mainstream of the twenty-first century.
How Turkey navigates the Syrian debacle will determine its position in the broader transformation of its neighborhood.

Iran’s Crippled Currency
<P>
MONTREAL – Escalating economic woes, aggravated by increasingly stringent international sanctions that prohibit transactions with Iran’s central bank and oil companies, are fueling unrest in Iran, as the value of the country’s currency, the rial, plummets.
In just 18 months, the rial’s exchange rate against the dollar has fallen by two-thirds.
<P>
Reluctant to engage militarily with Iran, and facing increasing pressure from Israel, the United States will most likely continue to push for and apply tough economic sanctions, with two major objectives in its sights.
First, the US hopes to force Iran to cooperate fully with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, by bringing its nuclear program into compliance with the international community’s demands.
Second, economic hardship and the threat of further isolation could compel Iran’s leaders to modify fundamentally their domestic and international policies.
<P>
While Iran’s leaders have often downplayed the sanctions’ impact, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has recently cited them as the primary culprit behind Iran’s economic turmoil.
But Iran has faced similar economic difficulties before – in the 1980’s, oil exports fell significantly amid the country’s eight-year war with Iraq, and in 1986-2000 global oil prices were extremely low – and handled them relatively well.
Four factors have made the oil embargo particularly unbearable today.
<P>
First, prohibiting oil exports is more painful when world oil prices are rising.
Ahmadinejad has benefited from a massive increase in the price of oil, resulting in unprecedented earnings.
Oil revenue reached a record high of more than $81 billion in 2010, more than three times its historical average.
And more than 50% of Iran’s total oil revenues during the preceding century were earned during Ahmadinejad’s eight years in office.
<P>
Second, the increase in oil revenue heightened Iran’s reliance on imports, which the government encouraged in order to fight domestic inflation.
According to the Iranian Council of Trade, Mining, and Agriculture, the value of imported goods totaled more than $56 billion in 2010, meaning that roughly 70% of total oil revenue was spent on imports.
As Iran imported everything from consumer goods to industrial materials and machinery, almost every sector of its economy became increasingly dependent on foreign goods, forcing small and medium-size producers to shut down.
<P>
The third factor is excessive control of the currency supply.
Given increased dollar revenues and easy access to dollars, the government was able to maintain a fixed nominal exchange rate.
But as dollars became less accessible, while domestic production fell and imports rose, rial devaluation became inevitable.
<P>
Finally, by cutting energy subsidies and depositing the payments directly in people’s bank accounts, Iran’s government increased household cash holdings and the market’s overall liquidity.
But this created a gap in the government’s balance sheet between direct payments and the savings from the cut in subsidies.
To fill it, the government printed money, effectively devaluing the currency and exacerbating inflation from rising prices for imported goods.
Meanwhile, budget imbalances remain, and have been aggravated by the current oil embargo.
<P>
Iran has three options for overcoming its current economic hardships: restructure the economy, balance the budget, and promote exports through a robust fiscal policy.
But Iran is unlikely to be able to take advantage of the rial’s low value to restructure its economy, or to increase exports in the short run, given that oil remains the country’s most important export, and current sanctions severely limit the quantities in which it can be sold.
<P>
Two possible scenarios remain.
In the first, less likely scenario, Iran would experience hyperinflation, skyrocketing unemployment, and generally poor economic prospects, as Zimbabwe has since 2000.
<P>
The second scenario resembles Argentina’s experience: a severe socioeconomic crisis triggers unrest and ultimately prompts reform.
The country’s economic health would slowly be restored through a lengthy process of restructuring and the adoption of more responsible monetary and fiscal policies.
<P>
In order to defuse the current economic panic, Iranian officials have proposed a nine-step plan, in which they would gradually suspend production of medium-enriched uranium in exchange for the immediate dismantling of sanctions.
But the US has dismissed the plan as unworkable.
<P>
Iran’s leaders must consider whether to engage in another round of negotiations with the IAEA, and the extent to which they are willing to yield on their nuclear activities.
Given domestic political instability, the government’s opaque nature, and an ever-changing regional context, it is impossible to predict their decision.
From an economic perspective, cooperation would benefit Iran more.

PS [In Depth]: Deconstructing the Urbanization Challenge
<P>
By 2030, the global labor force will number some 3.5 billion workers, up from 2.9 billion today.
Creating enough jobs that fast would be hard enough in the best of times; when so many of them must be concentrated in fast-growing urban hubs in developing countries, the potential for lapses is high, with serious implications for poverty reduction, economic development, and even social stability.

<P>
The stakes of failure to meet the jobs challenge are high, not least because it would mean continued increase in urban poverty.
Higher poverty rates exacerbate – and are exacerbated by – virtually every other urbanization-related problem, beginning with housing.
<P>
The infrastructure imperative does not end with housing, either.
The inability to access electricity has become a defining feature of urban poverty, with just 58% of city dwellers in Africa having reliable supplies in 2012.
And in view of the urgent need to fight climate change, Africa needs to invest in clean energy sources.
<P>
The challenges facing city-dwellers are disproportionately borne by the poor.
Health is no exception: people living in wealthy neighborhoods have a much higher life expectancy than those living in slum conditions.
With high levels of inequality already disrupting politics in many countries, the risks of creating a vicious cycle of poverty and poor health are all the more acute.

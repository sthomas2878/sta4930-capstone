The Constitutional Market
<P>
FREIBURG: In one obvious way, the state and the market are mutually exclusive.
Resources and rights controlled by the state are removed from the arena of private transactions called the market.
Until now the postcommunist transition focused on shifting resources and rights from the public to the private.
<P>
But in another, equally obvious, way the state and market are partners, not antagonists.
Only the state can provide the institutional superstructure for a properly functioning market.
An indispensable part of the transition lies in transforming the sclerotic, overgrown socialist state into one that provides this support for free enterprise.
For a society’s ability to create wealth depends, critically, on the "rules of the game" which it adopts; that is, on institutions that determine the ways in which economic activities are carried out.
Here an irony intrudes: under socialism private markets were crushed by the state; under capitalism, markets function well only when the state provides a nourishing legal/institutional environment.
<P>
So the market is not merely the absence of state control, but requires a set of appropriate rules in which transactions take place.
Stripping property and other rights from the state will not necessarily allow the former socialist economies to develop efficiently.
The robber barons’ capitalism rampant throughout much of the postcommunist world is abundant proof of this.
<P>
A recent Nobel laureate in economics, Douglas North, describes the type of state the postcommunist countries now require as a double-edged sword.
By providing and enforcing suitable rules of the game, and so deterring private predations conducted through fraud and coercion, the state acts as a facilitator of commerce.
It thereby encourages the production of wealth.
This side of the state/sword must be kept sharp, with the state effective in performing its tasks as protective state and guardian of the law.
<P>
Yet, as business people throughout the former socialist world know, the state (the political process) can itself be an instrument of predation -- an instrument of private enrichment through politically orchestrated transfers of resources.
This can be achieved by obtaining privileges or special rights from government or the legislature, privileges that may come in the form of monopoly rights, subsidies, protectionist privileges or other kinds of preferences.
<P>
In the postcommunist transition countries this is an old story: bureaucrats gauge bribes; insiders rig privatization auctions.
Where governments grant such privileges, insiders gain wealth, but society is beggared because it becomes less efficient in generating new wealth.
Promoting a society’s capacity to create wealth requires that only the guardian side of the sword be sharp and its underside dull.
But it is a tricky business to make the state powerful enough to play its role as guardian effectively, but not so overweening as to become a redistributive or patronage state.
<P>
A functioning market, one with desirable working properties, is not a gift of nature or something that emerges inevitably when the state leaves room for private economic activity.
Establishing an effective market means moving beyond such things as privatization toward providing an arena where private actors can buy and sell without fear of predators enriching themselves through cheating or bias.
<P>
That the market is an organizational ideal is an important message for citizens in the postcommunist countries, where public resentment against what is perceived as the market economy often manifests itself in a nostalgia for socialism and its control mechanisms.
It is important for people to recognize that much of what they tend to blame on markets is due to the fact that the double-edged state is too dull to play its protective role for private economic activity, but too sharp in allowing the old nomenklatura and its cronies to carve up state property, often the law itself, in order to enjoy predatory profits.
<P>
So will inviting the state to set the "rules of the game" mean empowering the fox to referee the chickens?
Certainly politicians are predisposed to establish self-serving rules.
But there are two ways to force the state to act as an honest broker:
<P>
• Constitutionalize the most basic economic decisions.
By inserting into a country’s constitution restrictions on, say, the ability of governments to run deficits, or suspend currency convertibility, these decisions are effectively stripped from the normal horse-trading of politics.
If politicians want to override or undermine such provisions, they must either change the constitution or flaunt it -- neither of which are particularly attractive options because the stakes are so high.
<P>
• Institutionalize primary economic decisions by vesting them in independent bodies that exist at arms’ length from politicians.
Examples of this type of insulated economic decisionmaking are independent central banks or currency boards charged with the duty of keeping inflation low; courts that protect private property; and securities and exchange commissions responsibile for preserving the integrity of financial markets.
<P>
Whether the market works to benefit all of its participants depends on its institutional framework.
Creating an "economic constitution" that minimizes political interference in core economic functions is the most reliable way to make certain that markets function freely and fairly.
The extent to which this framework is provided will depend on the nature of the political process, on clear rules of the game in the political arena, on the presence of constraints -- formal and informal -- on governments that prevent politicians and bureaucrats from predatory acts.
This is, to be sure, a laborious and neverending task, one which not only the transition societies face, but that constituents of Western welfare states must also now begin to confront.

A Corporate Manifesto
<P>
Around the world, countries are undergoing transitions to democracy.
Although democratic development varies, democratization always changes relations between business and government.
In Mexico, for example, liberalization of elections expanded the opposition's representation in parliament, ending domination of the executive over legislation and policy.
Now small businesses have new opportunities to make their voices heard.
<P>
In every country, there are differences in interests and goals within the business community.
Small firms have different interests from large multinationals in areas such as labor relations, tax policy and health care.
The degree to which business interests are fragmented based on policy issues, cronyism or other factors often indicates the degree of distortion in the underlying market economy.
<P>
One split divides firms dependent upon import protection from those engaged in international trade.
In many countries, protectionism nurtures "hot-house industries" that cannot compete in world markets.
The influence that bureaucrats enjoy here fosters corruption.
The result is a form of state socialism whose major beneficiary is a well-connected business elite that excludes genuine entrepreneurs and their employees.
<P>
Major differences also divide firms that remain publicly owned from those privatized, as well as from those always private.
Public sector firms have incentives to lobby for subsidies, protection and cheap credit.
They use their work forces to stall reform.
Conversely, private firms tend to support a more open and competitive economy and society.
<P>
These splits have implications for how business can affect policymaking.
Although every country and region is unique, businesses can forge unified positions based on national goals and a common strategy.
In some Latin American countries, business organizations draw their members from the small business community, companies engaged in international trade, or business leaders who invest in new technologies.
<P>
In some countries - say, Nicaragua and El Salvador - economies had so worsened that nearly all business people joined in opposition to the status quo, though disagreements existed about future goals.
Their challenge was to unite many businesspersons and others to argue for opening the economy, reforming fiscal and tax policies, and other fundamental changes.
<P>
In Mexico during the 1980s, COPARMEX, the Mexican employer's association, was one of the few voluntary business associations.
It opposed statist economic policies, as well as the cat's cradle of business, government, and the vast machinery of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) which governs Mexico.
<P>
Throughout the 1980s, COPARMEX lobbied for Mexico to join GATT, implement fiscal and tax reform, and initiate a privatization process.
Today, COPARMEX is the leader in public educational meetings concerning the role of business in a democratic society, communicating a public policy agenda, and the need for free enterprise.
<P>
As Latin America, the Philippines and others abandon import substitution and adjust to the international market economy, business interests change as well.
According to Hernan Buchi, an architect of Chile's economic reforms, some of the strongest opposition came from government-owned enterprises and firms engaged in business with the government.
After Chile embarked upon market reforms, those firms adapted in time.
<P>
The public policy interests of business are not fixed, shifting according to changes in the overall economy, trends in domestic and international markets, and the actions of business leaders.
Such shifts occurred in India with the economic reform program begun by Rajiv Ghandi and deepened by finance minister, Manmohan Singh.
Several Indian businesses, especially larger firms, resisted, clinging to benefits protectionist measures introduced under Nehru.
Some firms - particularly companies interested in world markets and dependent upon imports - called for change.
Over time, the association of these companies grew and became the Confederation of Indian Industry.
<P>
A vital tool to affect public policy is a national business agenda identifying the highest priority reforms.
The agenda specifies the needed laws and regulations and offers concrete suggestions for change.
For example, the Federation of Egyptian Industry is working on a national agenda including:
<P>
1.
Analyzing policies and forming recommendations;
<P>
2.
Meeting with members in open forums to discuss alternatives;
<P>
3.
Publishing in the media to gain input from concerned parties;
<P>
4.
Formulating policy reform programs;
<P>
5.
Publicizing the agenda;
<P>
6.
Advocacy directed at government.
<P>
Elsewhere, the Nigerian Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines, and Agriculture (NACCIMA) used its agenda over several years to coordinate economic reform.
In 1999, this task assumed critical importance due to the country's opening to democracy.
<P>
A legislative advisory program is another tool business can use to influence public policy.
To shape legislation such programs require:
<P>
* sound economic analysis, and background papers readily available for technocrats and others to study;
<P>
* calls to the country's general interests, as opposed to the interests of particular groups, such as business or labor;
<P>
* broad dissemination, with arrangements made with the media in order to provide even wider coverage.
<P>
In their attempts to affect public policy, business organizations influence government personnel, as well as legislators.
In India, although economic policy changes have been made, state-level government officials need to be convinced that reforms benefit their communities before they drop entrenched opposition.
The New Delhi-based PHD Chamber of Commerce has organized 31 business-government dialogues throughout northern India to reach state-level government officials, senior business people and academics.
The seminars:
<P>
* instill a "can do" rather than "can't do" attitude among officials;
<P>
* eliminate the "anti-profit" mentality;
<P>
* expedite permits and licenses by creating one-stop shops in state offices.
<P>
In postcommunist countries, where business is often deeply divided, influence on public policy has been catalyzed through strategic coalitions.
Romania's International Center for Entrepreneurial Studies (ICES) found that most business associations were captive to either government-owned enterprises or to firms privatized by the former communist nomenklatura.
ICES began to work with entrepreneurs and found that several sectoral associations - such as software - and small business associations from outlying areas of Romania were pushing for a market economy.
However, they were individually weak and unaware of each other's efforts.
During a training program on management, the associations began to coalesce.
Today, SABA's members are implementing a detailed legislative advisory program.
<P>
The manner in which business crafts its case can affect the likelihood of success.
Business must define issues to attract popular attention.
Job creation and economic growth are two essential lures.
Other highly visible issues - corporate governance and combating corruption - also attract large followings.
<P>
Indeed, the Asian and Russian economic crises raised corporate governance to the first rank of policy issues.
Interlocking relations among companies in South Korea, Indonesia and elsewhere, coupled with the lack of standards and requirement for disclosure, were key factors in Asia's crisis.
<P>
The World Bank, International Monetary Fund, international investors, and domestic constituencies are currently demanding change.
Business organizations in many countries have a unique opportunity to step in and promote reform in order to help reshape the structure of their business environments.
If they fail to do so, the environment may be reshaped around them in adverse ways.
<P>
Another strategy to advance economic reform is to combat corruption.
Transparency International, an international nonprofit organization, is mobilizing a broad constituency behind efforts to reform government procurement systems by advocating a code of conduct for government purchases.
<P>
Other groups fight corruption in their own countries.
For example, the Ecuadorian Association of Businessmen (ANDE) recently launched an anti-corruption program that focused on the root causes of corruption.
A survey of existing laws and regulations found that many of them were contradictory and overlapping.
ANDE proposed creation of a new court by amending the constitution.
It was successful due to strong public support for combating corruption.
The new court is empowered to reconcile or revoke laws that contain conflicts and duplications.
<P>
Each firm and business association must decide on the best strategies and tactics to pursue in their countries.
The important thing is for business leaders to get together and respond to these challenges.

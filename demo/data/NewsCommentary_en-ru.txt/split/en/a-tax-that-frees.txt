A Tax that Frees
<P>
KIEV: It used to be said that "What's good for General Motors is good for America."
Over the past few years, Russia appears to have been governed by a similar creed: "What's good for Gazprom is good for Russia."
Indeed, until his abrupt dismissal this spring, Viktor Chernomyrdin, one of that gas company's communist era managers, was Russia's prime minister.
Now, at long last, Gazprom may be brought to heel.
A deadline for Gazprom to pay billions of dollars in overdue taxes has been set for next week.
Is cutting Gazprom down to size a good omen for Russia?
<P>
The history of the postcommunist transition has been a struggle between reformers who tried to build a market economy and ruthless businessmen, like Gazprom's managers, who thrive on only partly liberated markets, subsidized credits, import subsidies, export rents, and non-payment of taxes.
They bought commodities whose domestic prices were kept low by state regulation and resold them abroad shielded by export regulations.
They skirted privatization because they made more money off the state.
<P>
These distortions of the transition were far greater in the countries of the former Soviet Union than in Central Europe.
That is a major reason why the costs of the transformation have been so much higher in the former Soviet Union than in Central Europe in terms of a larger decline in production, larger income differentials, and greater poverty.
<P>
Nonetheless, a year ago, Western investors poured billions of dollars into Russia's stock market, which appeared sound, and Russian shares sky-rocketed in 1996 and 1997.
Alas, companies started robbing minority shareholders by all means possible.
By manipulating product prices, they transferred profits to enterprises with no minority shareholders.
They issued stocks far below market prices to themselves, and transferred assets from one company to another without payment, stealing from the owners of the first company.
Rather than being punished, these crooks emerged as model "capitalists."
As a result, Russian stock prices fell by no less than 75% from October 1997 till July 1998.
<P>
Foreign direct investors have hardly fared better.
Moscow and Kiev are full of stories of initially successful foreign investors unlawfully forced to leave without compensation by their not very grateful partners.
Soon afterwards, these crooked businessmen raise all prices, diminishing the assortment of products on offer, and the service.
Moreover, such businessmen do not pay employee wages if they can avoid it and often get away with it.
<P>
Yet, the preferred booty of big post-Soviet businessmen remains state benefits.
The most straightforward ripoff is state-tolerated tax avoidance.
Gazprom, in its long-running feud with the Kremlin, demanded that the Russian government allow it to pay only half its due taxes, not to mention its tax debts.
If the state is to represent the whole population, however, it must do away with blatant tax holidays for big business.
<P>
This won't be easy.
Big post-Soviet businessmen prefer complicated schemes so that few can understand what is really going on.
A favorite ploy is to manipulate the non-cash payment of bills.
Last year, the Karpov Commission "Report on the 200 biggest Russian Companies" showed that they made less than 25% of their payments of salaries or to other businesses in actual money.
Instead, they paid and were paid in barter or off-sets (zachety).
Within Russia, markets exist for both these money surrogates.
One ruble in off-sets is traded for 20 kopecks, and one barter ruble is worth half a cash ruble.
<P>
Big Russian companies pay most of their taxes with off-sets, which means that they extract right there a subsidy of 80% of the taxes they actually pay.
Also, instead of paying their taxes, they offer local and federal governments barter deals.
Typically, construction companies suggest that a local government accept payment in the form of public construction.
By doing this local authorities deprive themselves of the choice of contractors, and cannot check the price, quality, or even the execution of the work.
Today's biggest political struggle in Russia concerns whether the government should force big companies, like Gazprom, to pay taxes in real cash.
<P>
The state also privileges some businesses and chokes others through its control of access to the market.
Throughout the post-Soviet world it is virtually impossible to run an enterprise without contacts with state authorities.
Local governments control entrepreneurs through licensing, inspections, certifications, and arbitrary taxation.
This bureaucratic stranglehold shackles competition, raises prices far too high, inhibits choice, and retards the quality of goods and services.
<P>
A key indicator of economic vitality is the number of legally registered enterprises per population.
In the West, there is about one enterprise per ten inhabitants.
Poland and Hungary have reached that frequency.
But Russia has only one enterprise per 55 people, and Ukraine one per 80 people, far too little for decent market competition to take place.
<P>
The only way of getting these awful business practices under control is to harness a state which corrupts today's businessmen and which, in turn, is corrupted by the most successful of them.
A number of practical steps are needed:
<P>
-- the number of bureaucrats must be reduced to a bare minimum.
Estonia, Kyrgyzstan and Georgia have already succeeded at this;
<P>
-- the tax system must be simplified and minimized so that other Gazproms cannot avoid taxes in a thicket of regulations.
Estonia, Georgia and Kazakhstan have achieved this end;
<P>
-- regulatory legislation which invites grotesque state intrusion in the market must be abolished;
<P>
-- the power of bureaucrats must be severely check by all legal and administrative means.
<P>
Across the former Soviet empire the state remains far too intrusive to allow the economy to flourish.
Strange as it may sound, forcing Gazprom to pay its fair share of taxes is a necessary step in cutting the state down to size.

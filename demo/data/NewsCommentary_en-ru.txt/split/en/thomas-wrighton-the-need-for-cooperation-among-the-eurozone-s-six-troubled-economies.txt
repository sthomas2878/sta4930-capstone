The Periphery Six
<P>
WASHINGTON, DC – Cyprus, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain share a problem.
With massive debt, no control over monetary policy, and no leeway for fiscal stimulus, they appear headed for a lost decade of high unemployment and low GDP growth.
Such a path would drain the political establishment of legitimacy and prevent a real recovery in Europe.
<P>
With structural reforms having proved inadequate to deliver sustained growth, a change in the external environment is needed.
The most obvious scenario would be for the global economy to grow rapidly enough to rescue Europe from stagnation.
But the growth slowdown in emerging economies and mixed economic news from the United States make this unlikely.
<P>
Alternatively, the eurozone could change course, stimulating demand, mutualizing debt, and loosening monetary policy.
But this would be impossible without Germany, and it is unlikely that the new German government – almost certainly to be led by Angela Merkel again, with Wofgang Schäuble returning as Finance Minister again, will be willing to pursue such a strategy.
The problem is that this scenario may well be the only way that the eurozone’s troubled economies can avoid a lost decade.
In this sense, any chance at recovery will require skillful foreign policy as much as effective economic policy.
<P>
Over the last five years, the troubled economies have worked hard to distinguish themselves from one another.
As Greece’s situation went from bad to worse, the others attempted to reassure the markets, “We are not Greece.”
And there has been almost no formal cooperation among them, with each bargaining separately with Germany and the European Central Bank.
<P>
That will have to change.
All six troubled countries are facing the prospect of being consigned to second-class status in the eurozone.
And they need eurozone policies that stimulate demand and provide some debt relief.
But that means uniting as a caucus to demand the policies on which their future prosperity depends.
<P>
This grouping, called the “Periphery Six” or P-6, could develop a political strategy to push the eurozone toward growth, voting as a bloc on relevant issues at European summits and within the eurozone.
While France would not be a member, it could be an important ally, given the current government’s opposition to austerity.
<P>
The P-6’s goals would include measures to reduce their debt burden and increase domestic demand, probably through targeted stimulus in Germany, the formation of a banking union with a robust resolution mechanism, and the introduction of Eurobonds.
The P-6 would also embark on a major diplomatic push to change perceptions within the rest of Europe.
This means ensuring that the eurozone’s stronger economies do not view the group as a “debtor’s cartel” threatening to default collectively and destabilize Europe further.
<P>
The collective bargaining power afforded by a coordinated diplomatic strategy would be sufficient to challenge the status quo.
It would also demonstrate to the P-6 countries’ citizens that their leaders are taking every reasonable measure to bring about economic recovery.
<P>
There is no time to lose.
The decisions that the eurozone takes over the next year will determine its future structure.
Now that Germany’s elections are over, the new government can be bolder if it so chooses.
The international climate outside of Germany has turned against austerity, with an increasing number of governments recognizing that it has failed.
<P>
Critics will likely argue that the creation of a P-6 would alienate Germany and divide Europe.
But this has already happened.
Unemployment in Austria and Germany stands at roughly 5%, while, in Spain and Greece, the jobless rate exceeds 25%.
If this two-tier structure is allowed to endure, it will tear Europe apart.
European integration cannot continue without a grand bargain between the two groups.
<P>
Political leaders in the P-6 have run out of domestic-policy options, but they have a window of opportunity to change the external environment.
They should waste no time in taking advantage of it.

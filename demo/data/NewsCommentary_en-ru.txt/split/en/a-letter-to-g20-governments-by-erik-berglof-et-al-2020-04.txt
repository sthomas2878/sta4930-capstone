A Letter to G20 Governments
<P>
LONDON – We are writing to call for immediate internationally coordinated action – within the next few days – to address our deepening global health and economic crises caused by COVID-19.
<P>
Project Syndicate commentators have once again shared some of their favorite books from the past year.
From economics, history, and long-form reporting to poetry and timely re-issues of old classics, all readers should find something of interest.
<P>
The communique from the G20 Extraordinary Leaders’ Summit on March 26, 2020, recognized the gravity and urgency of the entwined public health and economic crises, but we now require urgent specific measures that can be agreed on with speed and at scale: emergency support for global health initiatives led by the World Health Organization (WHO) and emergency measures to restore the global economy.
Both require world leaders to commit to funding far beyond the current capacity of our existing international institutions.
<P>
In 2008-2010, the immediate economic crisis could be surmounted when the economic fault line – under-capitalization of the global banking system – was tackled.
Now, however, the economic emergency will not be resolved until the health emergency is effectively addressed: the health emergency will not end simply by conquering the disease in one country alone, but by ensuring recovery from COVID-19 in all countries.
<P>
Global Health Measures
<P>
All health systems – even the most sophisticated and best funded – are buckling under the pressures of the virus.
Yet if we do nothing as the disease spreads in poorer African, Asian, and Latin American cities and in fragile communities which have little testing equipment, ventilators, and medical supplies, and where social distancing and even washing hands are difficult to achieve, COVID-19 will persist there and re-emerge to hit the rest of the world with further rounds that will prolong the crisis.
<P>
World leaders must immediately agree to commit $8 billion – as set out by the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board – to fill the most urgent gaps in the COVID-19 response.
<P>
This includes:
<P>
Enjoy unlimited access to the ideas and opinions of the world's leading thinkers, including weekly long reads, book reviews, and interviews; The Year Ahead annual print magazine; the complete PS archive; and more – All for less than $9 a month.
<P>
A further $35 billion will be required, as highlighted by the WHO, to support countries with weaker health systems and especially vulnerable populations, including the provision of vital medical supplies, surge support to the national health workforce (70% of whom in many countries are underpaid women), and strengthening national resilience and preparedness.
According to the WHO, almost 30% of countries have no national COVID-19 preparedness response plans; only half have a national infection prevention and control program.
Health systems in lower-income countries will struggle to cope; even the most optimistic estimates from Imperial College London suggest there will be 900,000 deaths in Asia and 300,000 in Africa.
<P>
We propose the convening of a global pledging conference – its task supported by a G20 Executive Task Force–to commit resources to meeting these emergency global health needs.
<P>
Global Economic Measures
<P>
Much has been done by national governments to counter the downward slide of their economies.
But a global economic problem requires a global economic response.
Our aim should be to prevent a liquidity crisis turning into a solvency crisis, and a global recession becoming a global depression.
To ensure this, better coordinated fiscal, monetary, central bank, and anti-protectionist initiatives are needed.
The ambitious fiscal stimuli of some countries will be all the more effective if more strongly complemented by all countries in a position to do so.
<P>
These allocations should be agreed to immediately, coordinated by a G20 Executive Task Force as part of the G20 Action Plan, and be confirmed in full at the upcoming IMF and World Bank meetings.
The two core economic institutions should be given reassurances that additional bilateral funding will be forthcoming and the need for further capital injections agreed.
<P>
The longer-term solution is a radical rethink of global public health and a refashioning – together with proper resourcing – of the global health and financial architecture.
<P>
The United Nations, the governments of the G20 nations, and interested partners should work together to coordinate further action.
<P>

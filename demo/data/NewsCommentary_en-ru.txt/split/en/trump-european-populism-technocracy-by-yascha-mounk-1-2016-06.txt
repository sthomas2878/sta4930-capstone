Illiberal Democracy or Undemocratic Liberalism?
<P>
CAMBRIDGE – How did it come to this?
In the space of a few short months, the prospect of a President Donald Trump has gone from preposterous speculation to terrifying possibility.
How could a man with so little political experience and such manifest disregard for facts get so close to the White House?
<P>
In a much-discussed essay, Andrew Sullivan recently argued that “too much democracy” is to blame for Trump’s rise.
According to Sullivan, the political establishment has been shoved aside by the anti-intellectualism of the far right and the anti-elitism of the far left.
Meanwhile, the Internet has amplified the influence of the angry and the ignorant.
What matters in politics today is not substance or ideology; it is a willingness to give voice to the people’s nastiest grievances – a skill at which Trump undoubtedly excels.
<P>
In an incisive response, Michael Lind argued that Sullivan gets things backwards: the real culprit is “too little democracy.”
Trump, he points out, has fared best among voters who believe that “people like me don’t have any say.”
<P>
And there’s a reason why more and more voters feel that way.
Some of the most important political decisions are now made by technocrats.
Even in policy areas where elected representatives still call the shots, they rarely reflect citizens’ preferences.
<P>
At first glance, the explanations offered by Sullivan and Lind seem to be mutually contradictory.
But, to make sense of the deepening crisis of liberal democracy – which has also emboldened far-right populists throughout Europe – we need to recognize that they are actually complementary.
<P>
The political systems of North America and Western Europe are defined by two core components.
They are liberal because they seek to guarantee the rights of individuals, including those of marginalized minorities.
And they are democratic because their institutions are supposed to translate popular views into public policy.
<P>
But in recent decades, as ordinary citizens’ living standards have stagnated and anger at the political establishment has skyrocketed, these two fundamental components of politics in the West have come into conflict.
As a result, liberal democracy is bifurcating, giving rise to two new regime forms: “illiberal democracy,” or democracy without rights, and “undemocratic liberalism,” or rights without democracy.
<P>
In more and more countries, vast swaths of policy have been cordoned off from democratic contestation.
Macroeconomic decisions are made by independent central banks.
Trade policy is enshrined in international agreements that result from secretive negotiations conducted within remote institutions.
Many controversies about social issues are settled by constitutional courts.
In those rare areas, like taxation, where elected representatives retain formal autonomy, the pressures of globalization have attenuated ideological differences between established center-left and center-right parties.
<P>
It is hardly surprising, then, that citizens on both sides of the Atlantic feel that they are no longer masters of their political fate.
For all intents and purposes, they now live under a regime that is liberal, yet undemocratic: a system in which their rights are mostly respected but their political preferences are routinely ignored.

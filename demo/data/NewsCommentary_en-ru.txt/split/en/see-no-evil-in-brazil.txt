See No Evil in Brazil
<P>
CAMBRIDGE: Brazil survived its elections.
President Cardoso has gotten his second term by the skin of his teeth, not with the mandate for which he hoped.
Instead of being over, his troubles are only starting.
<P>
Cardoso did just about anything to get reelected: spend, borrow, just keep the economy alive until election day.
To keep money coming, he shortened the maturity of domestic and foreign liabilities; to keep the music going he gave state governments leeway to spend money they didn't have.
It almost worked.
Almost, for capital flight is now rampant - $40 billion - and this does not count money the government spent behind the scenes buying back debt to support prices in world markets.
<P>
Facts must be faced.
Public debt has risen near 40%.
The budget deficit is 8% of GDP; the current account deficit comes to 4% in a year where growth is near zero.
The maturity of domestic debt is very short, of external debt even shorter.
Everything is in a rollover situation where confidence is paramount.
Without such, Brazil will go over the cliff faster than Korea.
<P>
Why be confident?
In fact, there is substantial skepticism, witnessed by capital flight to the order of 4-5 billion $US weekly.
The IMF package of $30 billion - don't ask how much of that money is real and can be used - will not provide much in terms of confidence.
It will merely finance capital flight for a while, as in Russia.
<P>
Confidence will only come from a dramatic program that puts paid to the awful macroeconomics of two decades and creates a well-functioning market economy of the kind Argentina established early in the 1990s.
The plan hatched by the IMF and Brazil is this: a 2.4% cut in the budget, for more is said to be "politically impossible."
That cut is supposed to instill confidence, cause interest rates to fall from their current 30% real level, stop capital flight and thus bring stability.
Chances of that happening are not zero, but they don't exceed 20%.
<P>
Here is why.
First and least, the President may not get his 2.5% budget cut.
Cardoso never made a difficult decision; he only knows spending and borrowing, pay-offs for a second term.
He seems to think that Brazil, like some big firms, is simply "too large to fail."
Next and importantly, if budget cuts happen, they will create a recession: the estimate for Brazil is that a 2.5% budget cut will cause a 3% loss in GDP unless there is a dramatic offset from interest rates and confidence.
<P>
But interest rates are unlikely to fall.
As in Hong Kong, investors will argue that, in a recession, the temptation to devalue your way out of it is just too overwhelming.
Hence interest rates will stay high, the budget will not improve, recession will weaken Cardoso's political base, and further budget cutting becomes doubtful as a vicious cycle ensues.
With capital flight intensifying and domestic debt refinancing becoming ever harder, its a short step to capital controls and, perhaps, an uncontrolled currency problem.
<P>
Brazil's policy makers flatter themselves that they can live with crises forever.
Yes and true, but they may well have reached the end of their luck.
If they can't instill confidence, controls will complete the picture.
Needless to say, if Brazil fails it will take much of Latin America with it.
<P>
With the IMF in bailout frenzy, and Brazilian policymakers in denial, don't count on either for a successful program.
Four problems must be addressed:
<P>
* the maturity of debts must be lengthened to reduce interest burdens;
<P>
the exchange rate must be credibly frozen;
<P>
* the budget must be improved over and beyond what comes from any fall in interest rates;
<P>
* the economy must reduce statism, its rules must be made more transparent, and flexibility and competitiveness must be enhanced.
<P>
A currency board is the only plausible way for investors and the public to believe that the exchange rate is safe.
That is counter-cultural for Brazil, but anything less is unaffordable.
Public debt must be lengthened - unpleasant, but it has ample precedent.
Undertaking such a lengthening while events can be controlled need not cause any losses other than taking away the illusion of liquidity which investors now entertain but could not exercise because Brazil could not pay them.
<P>
A lengthening of much of the debt reduces interest burdens, stabilizes public finance and thus supports the currency.
But Brazil must go beyond "time out" measures on its debt by making a major effort toward a balanced budget.
Cuts must go well beyond 2.5% to create confidence that the Real Plan finally has its counterpart in fiscal stabilization.
Lastly, because the currency board freezes the exchange rate, stable rules and flexibility of wages and prices will need to carry the heaviest burden in making Brazil competitive.
<P>
Trimming the budget won't solve Brazil's problem; it simply invites a crisis a few months down the road.
Little comfort is to be taken if Brazil's crisis is less extreme than Russia's, but surely it is time tell the IMF to start adopting winning strategies rather than gamble on the seemingly less painful options peddled by client governments.
<P>
In order to allow Cardoso to win and keep the music playing, the IMF bought into the idea that Brazil's problem is the budget, not debt or the exchange rate, and that the budget is the fault of the Brazilian Congress.
Having peddled the story, the IMF is now locked into asking for a bit on the budget and handing over a big bailout package in return.
Here you should recall Keynes' saying: "in the street it is more acceptable to fail by conventional means than to succeed by unconventional ones."
That has been IMF strategy.
It explains the failure in Russia and, quite likely, the coming failure in Brazil.

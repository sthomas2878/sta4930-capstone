What the G20 Should Do Now
<P>
LONDON – The time is right for G20 leaders to hold a second meeting to discuss measures to advance the implementation of the G20 Action Plan, and agree to a more strongly coordinated global response to the health, economic, and social emergencies we face.
The G20 has demonstrated that it can bring people together around a common set of actions.
What it decides next on the COVID-19 response will have a direct bearing on the future of the world economy.
<P>
Project Syndicate commentators have once again shared some of their favorite books from the past year.
From economics, history, and long-form reporting to poetry and timely re-issues of old classics, all readers should find something of interest.
<P>
Our world is at a critical moment.
On May 30, the highest daily figure was recorded for new cases of COVID-19 worldwide.
On every continent, countries are attempting to stop the transmission of the virus.
Compared to pre-crisis levels, the International Labor Organization estimates a 10.5% decline in the number of hours worked, equivalent to the loss of more than 300 million full-time jobs.
For the first time this century, global poverty is on the rise.
<P>
Therefore, as we did a month ago, to emphasize the urgency of delivering immediate relief to countries facing the effects of an unprecedented, global crisis.
The problems faced by the poorest countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America demand immediate action, as do those confronting diverse middle-income economies.
Taken together, these countries represent nearly 70% of the world’s population and approximately one-third of global GDP.
<P>
The United Nations predicts that a worldwide recession would reverse three decades of improving living standards and plunge upwards of 420 million more people into extreme poverty.
The World Food Program has estimated that 265 million of our fellow citizens are likely to suffer from crisis levels of hunger – an increase of 130 million over pre-pandemic levels.
We are also hearing reports of the pressure on all health and other social services on which girls and women depend.
<P>
Moreover, COVID-19 has caused the greatest education emergency of our lifetime: 1.5 billion children – 80% of all children – have been out of school.
The majority are denied distance learning.
Many may never return – many, we fear, may enter child labor.
Millions who no longer receive school meals are going hungry, while at the same time education aid is being reduced.
<P>
The global economic and social emergency cannot end until we can bring the global health emergency to an end.
And we cannot bring the health emergency to an end in any of our countries until we end it in all countries.
<P>
We welcome the $8 billion pledged on May 4 for vaccines, diagnostics, and therapeutic development as recommended by the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board, and urge that these contributions be paid immediately and be fully monitored and reported.
But much more needs to be done:
<P>
We note not only the multiple obstacles faced by developed countries in returning to growth, but also the deteriorating economic and fiscal conditions faced by many emerging, middle- income, and developing economies.
More than 100 countries have now approached the International Monetary Fund for help, and more are expected to do so.
<P>
The IMF has said emerging markets and developing countries need $2.5 trillion to overcome the crisis, but only a fraction of that $2.5 trillion has so far been allocated.
<P>
While we welcome the good intentions at the heart of the G20 Action Plan, concrete measures must urgently be agreed and be implemented in full:
<P>
The consequences of not acting now would be felt for the rest of the decade.
This is a time when countries should be willing to go beyond their normal fiscal deficit ceilings.
The poorest, whose fiscal capacity is limited, need additional financial support from rich countries and multilateral organizations.
<P>
Social safety nets, regular health services, education, and climate-change initiatives – and for the 2030 timetable for the Sustainable Development Goals – must not suffer because of the fight to mitigate COVID-19 transmission.
Thus:
<P>
In the first stage of the crisis, the emphasis was on the provision of liquidity, employment protection, and emergency investments in health.
Now, as we seek to return the world economy to pre-crisis levels of growth, enhanced fiscal, monetary, and central-bank coordination is vital.
<P>
Without action from the G20, the recession caused by the pandemic will only deepen, hurting all economies – and the world’s most marginalized and poorest peoples and nations the most.
Representing 85% of the world’s nominal GDP, the G20 has the capacity to lead the mobilization of resources on the scale required.
We urge leaders to do so immediately.
<P>
COVID-19 is a wake-up call to the global community.
The global health and financial architecture must be strengthened, and in parts redesigned, to enhance our preparedness and capacity to act with speed and at scale to fight future crises.
We should send a message of hope for the future: that the UN, G20 governments, and all interested partners can turn this crisis into an opportunity to build a new and more effective multilateralism, which more appropriately reflects current economic and political realities and is better equipped to address the challenges of the twenty-first century.

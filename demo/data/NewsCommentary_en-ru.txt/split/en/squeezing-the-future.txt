Squeezing the Future
<P>
BOSTON: Few people desire to saddle their children with mountains of debt as an inheritance.
After decades of pushing the costs of today’s expenditures and promises onto future generations, that bit of family wisdom appears - at long last - to be influencing government policy.
<P>
Most West European countries lowered budget deficits to 3% of GDP to meet the terms for joining the European Monetary Union.
America has recorded a balanced budget after five years of sharp trimming.
In the transition countries, belt-tightening is a key part of free market reforms.
So, are future generations now safe from fiscal profligacy now that hard fiscal discipline seems in place?
Unfortunately, future generations remain under threat.
<P>
The problem is that balanced budgets and stable debt-to-national income ratios are poor indicators of generational equity.
Why?
Government promises made today but doled out tomorrow, such as social security payments, do not show up in annual budgets.
Nor do standard accounting methods tell us which generation must ultimately pay for government consumption spending.
An innovation called "generational accounting" sheds new light on the issue of generational equity.
<P>
"Generational accounting" assumes that all generations, including those not yet born, will receive the same per-capita level of transfers and government purchases.
These two items, plus a country’s net debt, comprise what must be paid for in taxes.
The question, then, is to divide the bill among current and future generations.
<P>
Generational balance occurs when a current newborn faces the same tax burden over a lifetime as a representative member of a future generation.
If a future taxpayer is to pay more in net taxes (taxes minus transfers) than a current newborn in order to receive the same level of public goods, then the current generation is not paying for its own consumption but is, instead, imposing debts on its own children and grandchildren.
<P>
According to case studies of 17 countries, the world’s leading economic powers (America, Germany, Japan), as well as a wide range of other countries, are pursuing fiscal policies that inflict heavy burdens on future generations.
Japan and Germany are among the countries with extreme generational imbalances, along with Italy, Brazil and the Netherlands.
If future generations in these countries are to receive the same per-capita level of public goods, their net lifetime taxes will be at least 75% higher than the taxes facing current newborns.
Italy’s future generations, for example, can expect to pay 131.8% higher lifetime net taxes if current policies are maintained.
<P>
Most countries in the study do not fare much better.
Norway, Portugal, Argentina, Belgium and America all have substantial imbalances, imposing a 50 % to 75% increase in net lifetime taxes for future generations through their current fiscal policies.
The corresponding increase for France, Denmark and Australia is 30 % to 50%.
<P>
Canada alone is pursuing essentially balanced generational policies.
In only three countries - New Zealand, Thailand and Sweden - are generational balances negative, meaning that those countries are leaving generations yet born with lower lifetime net taxes than current newborns.
<P>
Demographics is the primary cause of generational imbalances.
Although annual population growth is positive today in all 17 countries, it will decline dramatically.
By 2030, Germany, Italy, Japan and the Netherlands will be the oldest countries, with over one quarter of their populations elderly.
As a result, the need for government transfers, such as health benefits and state pensions will increase, but the relatively smaller share of working taxpayers in the population will make it harder to pay these charges.
This problem grips the postcommunist countries, where ageing populations are locked in a fiscally fatal combination with bloated Soviet-style pension systems.
<P>
If demographics did not play a role, a large majority of countries, including Germany, the United States, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, France, Norway, and Argentina would not have generational imbalances; they might even record a surplus.
Relative to demographics, the size of government net debt plays a smaller role in most countries.
The exception here is Belgium, where assuming zero net debt would leave future generations with surpluses.
Do the same in Germany, Italy, Australia and France and you eliminate half the generational imbalance.
<P>
These results suggest that future generations can expect serious hardships, problems they would want resolved by those who are causing them.
But current generations, wary of increasing their own tax burdens or curtailing their benefits, may not be willing to tackle these issues.
Delay, however, will only make matters worse.
<P>
Failure to act now means permitting each new generation that is born to benefit from the same lifetime net tax rate as current generations.
As a result, generational imbalances - and the lifetime net taxes of future generations - will continue to pile up, until the tax burden will be too heavy to be imposed.
Postponing fiscal reform, besides being blatantly unfair, simply is not sustainable.
<P>
There is no easy path to fiscal sustainability and generational balance.
Achieving these goals will require that countries pursue some combination of higher taxes and lower government transfers and spending.
It is imperative that policymakers and politicians understand that a balanced budget and stable debt to income ratio in any one year is no indication that future generations will be spared the burden of overspending by today’s generation.
<P>
Many countries, particularly in Europe, breathed a sigh of relief when membership in EMU was announced.
The hard work of fiscal responsibility seemed at an end.
Such self-satisfaction is misplaced.
The job is only just beginning.

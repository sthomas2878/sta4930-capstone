Yeltsin's Two Russian Faces
<P>
NEW YORK: Even by Boris Yeltsin’s wayward standards, the last few weeks have been frantic.
The Russian economy has cracked, as has the ruble, foreign bank loans are not being repaid, and Yeltsin’s new/old choice for prime minister - Viktor Chernomyrdin - is having trouble getting his nomination approved by the Duma.
Once again there is talk that Yeltsin is finished.
<P>
Russians are unaccustomed to parading themselves before the world as vulnerable and in need of a begging bowl.
So, to hear a procession of investment bankers proclaim that, realistically speaking, Russia’s economy is of no more importance to the world than Santo Domingo, was more than humiliating: deep down many Russians suspected that this might very well be true.
<P>
For centuries Russia appeared strong and powerful.
The guilty secret was that Russians made themselves appear strong because they were afraid that the world (i.e., the West) would discover their weaknesses.
Here the all-powerful Tsar was key to protecting the great Russian soul from the "evil" western influences of freedom and disorder.
Those freedoms had to be kept out if the country’s rampant vulnerabilities were to remain a family secret.
<P>
The time came, however, when Russia could no longer hide its flaws behind its vast steppes and iron curtain.
It became obvious that Russia, for all its bravado, was in fact an economic, political, and social basket case, and the country was in such a state precisely because it lacked those bracing Western freedoms.
<P>
Though Russia's facade of strength disintegrated over the past decade, the rhetoric of strength did linger on.
So, too, did devotion to the idea of a Tsar, to someone who can say: I will lead you to the brightest future; follow me.
The irony nowadays, however, is that that "bright future" is not to be found by keeping the West at bay (the role the Tsar almost always played) but by moving the country toward the West and its values.
<P>
Yeltsin, despite his myriad flaws, has been a perfect tsar for a transitional time, good for both Russians and for foreigners.
He bridged the old authoritarian tradition of one man making all political (and almost every other) decision of consequence, with a new openness in word and deed that helped convince the world that Yeltsin and the Russian people had become dedicated followers of democratic fashion.
<P>
Russia’s current crisis put Yeltsin's "double-sidedness" on bold display.
The firing and rehiring of Viktor Chernomyrdin within the span of five months appears to justify all the old canards that Yeltsin rules only by impulse, without any system of belief, ideas, or philosophy to guide him.
<P>
At times Yeltsin does play the democrat.
He goes on the stump in election campaigns and restricted himself to only two presidential terms.
He consults with Duma sessions, and attempted to design a younger more vigorous reform government; and so on and so on.
<P>
At other times Yeltsin acts as impetuously as any ordained Tsar: he passionately ordered his tanks to fire at his own Duma in1993, the clearest signal of all that he never intended to really share his unlimited autocratic power.
The war in Chechnya showed Yeltsin a man who would not even think about recognizing the first rule of democracy: self-determination, the right of any nation to choose its own independent path of development.
Moreover, over the years, Yeltsin was as mercurial as the worst of Russia’s monarchs in shifting his "boyars" in and out the "royal" circle.
<P>
Though the "democratic" Yeltsin pleased the West, particularly President Clinton it seems, the "autocratic"erratic Yeltsin was far more familiar to Russians.
The tsar is once more cruel and unpredictable; but he is ours, we know him.
<P>
Yeltsin’s inability over the past six years to choose a clear policy path and stick to it corresponds to these two sides of his nature: one authoritarian, the other a reformer.
But this leaves his adversaries and his friends in a quandary: is he just a typical dictatorial Russian leader of the sort America fought the Cold War against, or is he the man who, in order to be accepted as a member of the West and its best clubs - the G-7, EU, and their like - tolerates such unpleasant things for Russia as NATO's expansion right up to its border.
<P>
The now on-the-out reformers - Kirienko, Nemtsov, Chubais and their supporters - were supposed to serve the Westernization of Yeltsin and of Russia.
They clearly had ambitious and worthy and necessary aspirations for the country and its relationship with the world.
Instead, their ideas got trampled by the old authoritarian lusts.
Besides, their lean ambitiousness never really fit within the style of a traditional Russian leader - stout, slow-speaking and slow-moving.
If that looks and sounds familiar it is because Viktor Chernomyrdin is a paradigm of those traits.
<P>
That "heavyweight's" putative return as Yeltsin's number two (and it really is hard to imagine that, in the end the Duma will reject Chernomyrdin, he being so much like them) is like the shelling of the Duma, or the war in Chechnya: not particularly good for the country, but oh so well-known to Russians.
Chernomyrdin offers nothing surprising to Russians, and they don't mind that -- they are tired of surprises.
And the West too, even though disappointed at his return, probably realizes what it will get from him if today’s financial bloodletting can be stopped: reform, of a fashion and at a snail's pace.
<P>
There is another important issue here which most observers have overlooked: as a "transitional" Tsar Yeltsin can no longer rule alone.
He desperately needs a "vice-tsar."
For now he will retain the title of President, while real power will pass to Victor Chernomyrdin.
He may not be the best man to arrest today’s financial panic, but he is likely to be the best figure that the Duma will approve.
Only if - and it is a big if - the economy is stabilized is there hope that a real reform process can begin anew.
